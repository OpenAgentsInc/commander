- `utils/`: General utility functions (e.g., `tailwind.ts` for `cn` class merging helper).

## 4. Electron Architecture

- **Main Process**: Entry point `src/main.ts`.
  - Manages `BrowserWindow` lifecycle, native OS interactions.
  - Registers IPC listeners via `registerListeners` from `src/helpers/ipc/listeners-register.ts`.
  - Sets `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` for a custom title bar.
  - Installs React DevTools in development.
- **Renderer Process**: Entry HTML `index.html`, which loads `src/renderer.ts`, which in turn renders `src/App.tsx` (root React component).
  - Handles all UI rendering and user interaction within a window.
- **Preload Script**: `src/preload.ts`.
  - Specified by `webPreferences.preload` in `src/main.ts`.
  - Runs in a privileged context, bridging main and renderer processes securely.
  - Exposes IPC functions to the renderer via `contextBridge` (see `src/helpers/ipc/context-exposer.ts`).
- **Context Isolation**: Enabled (`contextIsolation: true` in `src/main.ts` webPreferences).

## 5. Frontend (Renderer Details)

- **UI Components**:
  - Built with React 19 and Shadcn UI.
  - Shadcn UI components are located in `src/components/ui/`. Configuration: `components.json`.
  - Path alias for UI components: `@/components/ui`.
- **Styling**:
  - Tailwind CSS v4. Configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` in `vite.renderer.config.mts`.
  - Global styles and Tailwind layers in `src/styles/global.css`.
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark modes) defined in `src/styles/global.css`.
  - Default font: Berkeley Mono, defined in `src/styles/fonts.css` and applied in `global.css`.
- **Routing**:
  - TanStack Router. Configuration in `src/routes/`. Uses `createMemoryHistory`.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**:
  - Uses `i18next` and `react-i18next`.
  - Configuration: `src/localization/i18n.ts`.
  - Language toggle: `src/components/LangToggle.tsx` utilizes `src/helpers/language_helpers.ts`.

## 6. Key Features & Implementations

- **Custom Title Bar**:
  - Enabled by `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` in `src/main.ts`.
  - Draggable region component: `src/components/DragWindowRegion.tsx`.
  - Window controls (minimize, maximize, close) are handled via IPC (see `src/helpers/ipc/window/` and `src/helpers/window_helpers.ts`).
- **Theme Management (Dark/Light/System)**:
  - IPC-based communication between renderer and main process (see `src/helpers/ipc/theme/`).
  - Renderer-side logic: `src/helpers/theme_helpers.ts`.
  - UI toggle component: `src/components/ToggleTheme.tsx`.
  - Styling implemented using a `dark` class on the `<html>` element and CSS custom properties in `src/styles/global.css`.

## 7. Build & Configuration

- **`package.json`**: Core project manifest: name (`commander`), scripts, dependencies.
- **`forge.config.ts`**: Electron Forge configuration.
  - Integrates Vite for building main, preload, and renderer processes using `@electron-forge/plugin-vite`.
  - Defines "makers" for creating distributables (e.g., `.exe`, `.dmg`).
  - Uses `@electron-forge/plugin-fuses` for enhanced security settings.
- **Vite Configurations**:
  - `vite.main.config.ts`: For the main process.
  - `vite.preload.config.ts`: For the preload script.
  - `vite.renderer.config.mts`: For the renderer process (includes React plugin with React Compiler and Tailwind CSS plugin).
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler options. Includes the path alias `@/*` mapping to `src/*`.
- **`eslint.config.mjs`**: ESLint configuration. Enables `eslint-plugin-react-compiler`.
- **`components.json`**: Shadcn UI settings (e.g., component paths, Tailwind config).

## 8. Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Framework: Vitest, with React Testing Library.
  - Configuration: `vitest.config.ts`. Tests located in `src/tests/unit/`.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
  - Framework: Playwright.
  - Configuration: `playwright.config.ts`. Tests located in `src/tests/e2e/`.

## 9. Important NPM Scripts (from `package.json`)

- `pnpm start`: Run the app in development mode with hot reloading.
- `pnpm package`: Package the application into platform-specific bundles.
- `pnpm make`: Create distributable installers/archives.
- `pnpm lint`: Check code for linting errors using ESLint.
- `pnpm format:write`: Format code using Prettier.
- `pnpm test`: Run Vitest unit tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: Run Playwright E2E tests (requires a prior build via `package` or `make`).
- `pnpm test:all`: Run both unit and E2E tests.

## 10. Key Conventions & Preferences

- **Context Isolation**: Enabled for security between main and renderer processes.
- **React Compiler**: Enabled by default for potential performance optimizations.
- **Shadcn UI**: Add new components using `npx shadcn@canary add <component-name>` for compatibility with React 19 and Tailwind v4.
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@/*` to refer to paths relative to the `src/` directory.
- **Custom Title Bar**: The application uses a custom, frameless window title bar.

This document should provide a solid foundation for understanding and working with the OpenAgents Commander codebase. For more specific details, refer to the individual configuration files mentioned and the original `README-template.md`.

## 11. Logging and Telemetry

For all application logging, event tracking, and diagnostics, the **`TelemetryService` MUST be used**. This ensures a centralized and controllable way to manage diagnostic data.

**Key Principles:**

- **Development Mode:** By default, the `TelemetryService` logs its events to the `console.log`. This provides immediate visibility for developers.
- **Production Mode:** By default, the `TelemetryService` is silent and performs no logging operations.
- **User Control:** The `setEnabled` method on the service allows for UI controls to override the default behavior if needed.

**Usage Guidelines:**

- **DO NOT USE `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, `console.error()`, `console.info()`, or `console.debug()` directly for application-level logging or diagnostics.**
  - These methods bypass our telemetry system.
  - They may be used for _temporary, local debugging only_ and **MUST be removed** before committing code.
- **USE `TelemetryService.trackEvent()` for all logging purposes.**

  - This includes informational messages, warnings, errors, and tracking of feature usage or significant application events.

- **Exceptions (Where `console.*` is still used):**
  - Inside `src/services/telemetry/TelemetryServiceImpl.ts` itself, for its own operational logging (e.g., the `[Telemetry]` prefix, or logging explicit calls to `setEnabled`).
  - In the fallback `.catch()` block when an attempt to call `TelemetryService.trackEvent()` itself fails. These specific calls are marked with `// TELEMETRY_IGNORE_THIS_CONSOLE_CALL`.
  - In `src/tests/vitest.setup.ts` for test environment setup.

**How to Use `TelemetryService.trackEvent()`:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:**

    ```typescript
    import { Effect, Layer, Cause, Exit } from "effect";
    import {
      TelemetryService,
      TelemetryServiceLive,
      type TelemetryEvent,
    } from "@/services/telemetry";
    ```

2.  **Construct your `TelemetryEvent` data:**
    When replacing old `console.*` calls, use the `category` mapping:

    - `console.log`/`console.info` -> `"log:info"`
    - `console.warn` -> `"log:warn"`
    - `console.error` -> `"log:error"`
    - `console.debug` -> `"log:debug"`

    ```typescript
    const eventData: TelemetryEvent = {
      category: "log:error", // e.g., for a console.error replacement
      action: "user_login_failure", // Or "generic_console_replacement"
      label: "User login failed for user_xyz", // Main message or context
      value: JSON.stringify({ reason: "Invalid password", attempt: 3 }), // Additional structured data, stringified
    };
    ```

3.  **Create and run the Effect program:**
    ```typescript
    Effect.gen(function* (_) {
      const telemetryService = yield* _(TelemetryService);
      yield* _(telemetryService.trackEvent(eventData));
    }).pipe(
      Effect.provide(TelemetryServiceLive), // Provide the service layer
      (effect) =>
        Effect.runPromise(effect).catch((err) => {
          // TELEMETRY_IGNORE_THIS_CONSOLE_CALL
          console.error(
            "TelemetryService.trackEvent failed:",
            err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err),
            Cause.pretty(err),
          ); // Fallback for telemetry system errors
        }),
    );
    ```
    - For code already running in an Effect context with `TelemetryServiceLive` provided, you can use:
    ```typescript
    yield *
      _(
        Effect.gen(function* (_) {
          const telemetryService = yield* _(TelemetryService);
          yield* _(telemetryService.trackEvent(eventData));
        }),
      );
    ```

# Agent Pitfalls and Best Practices (for CLAUDE.md)

This document outlines common pitfalls encountered by AI agents working on the OpenAgents Commander codebase, along with best practices to avoid them. Understanding these points will help future agents contribute more effectively and efficiently.

## 1. Effect-TS Usage

Effect-TS is a powerful library for building robust applications, but its specific patterns require careful attention.

### 1.1. Runtime Initialization

- **Pitfall:** Using `Effect.runSync` to build or initialize layers that involve asynchronous operations (e.g., `SparkWallet.initialize` in `SparkServiceImpl.ts`).
- **Consequence:** This can lead to an `AsyncFiberException` during startup. The application might then create a "fallback runtime" which lacks many essential services, leading to subsequent "Service not found" errors when components try to use those services.
- **Best Practice:**
  1.  The main application runtime (`mainRuntimeInstance` in `src/services/runtime.ts`) should be initialized asynchronously using `Effect.runPromise`.
  2.  The application entry point (e.g., `src/renderer.ts`) must `await` this asynchronous runtime initialization _before_ rendering the main React application.
  3.  Components and hooks should use the `getMainRuntime()` getter function to access the runtime, ensuring they get the fully initialized instance.
- **Reference:** See `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1219-instructions.md` for the fix involving `initializeMainRuntime` and `buildRuntimeAsync`.

### 1.2. Context Requirements (`R` Channel in Effects)

- **Pitfall:** Service interface methods (e.g., in `NIP90Service.ts`) declaring `R` channel dependencies (like `Effect.Effect<A, E, SomeDependencyService>`) when the service instance itself should already have these dependencies resolved during its layer construction.
- **Consequence:** TypeScript errors related to incompatible `R` types, particularly in tests or when composing effects, where an `Effect<..., ..., SomeDependency>` is not assignable to an expected `Effect<..., ..., never>`.
- **Best Practice:**
  1.  Methods defined in a service's interface should typically have `R = never` as their third type parameter. This signifies that once you have an instance of the service, its methods are self-contained regarding their original dependencies.
  2.  The service implementation (e.g., `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts`) resolves its dependencies (like `NostrService`, `NIP04Service`) from the context when its `Live` layer is built (usually within a `Layer.effect(ServiceTag, Effect.gen(function* (_) { ... }))` block). These resolved dependencies are then available in the closure scope of the implemented methods.
  3.  If a service method calls a _helper function_ that itself is an Effect requiring context (e.g., `createNip90JobRequest` helper needing `NIP04Service`), that context must be provided locally to the helper: `Effect.provideService(helperEffect, DependencyTag, instanceFromClosureScope)`.
- **Reference:** `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1154-instructions.md` details the fix for `NIP90Service` interface and implementation.

### 1.3. Error Handling in Effects

- **Pitfall:** Allowing errors from "fire-and-forget" side-effect operations (like telemetry calls via `TelemetryService.trackEvent`) to propagate and alter the primary Effect's error channel (`E`).
- **Consequence:** Unexpected error types in the main operational flow, making robust error handling difficult.
- **Best Practice:** For side effects where failure should not stop the main operation, handle their errors locally using `.pipe(Effect.ignoreLogged)` or a more specific `Effect.catch...` variant.
- **Reference:** Telemetry calls within service implementations (e.g., `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` in `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1016-instructions.md`).

- **Pitfall:** In tests, directly expecting a custom error type (e.g., `NIP90ValidationError`) when `Effect.runPromise` is used, as `Effect.runPromise` wraps typed errors in a `FiberFailure`.
- **Consequence:** Test assertions fail because `error instanceof NIP90ValidationError` might be false.
- **Best Practice:** When testing effects run with `Effect.runPromise` that are expected to fail with a typed error:
  1.  Catch the error (`e`).
  2.  Assert that `String(e)` contains the expected error message or name (e.g., `expect(String(e)).toContain("NIP90ValidationError")`).
  3.  Alternatively, if using `Effect.runPromiseExit`, check `Exit.isFailure(exit)` and then analyze `exit.cause` using `Cause.failureOption` or `Cause.squash` to get to the underlying typed error.
- **Reference:** `NIP90Service.test.ts` error assertion fixes in `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1203-analysis.md` and `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1204-fix-failure.md`.

### 1.4. Schema Usage (`effect/Schema`)

- **Pitfall:** Using `Schema.Array(...)` (uppercase 'A') instead of the correct `Schema.array(...)` (lowercase 'a').
- **Consequence:** `TypeError: Schema.Array is not a function` during runtime or test execution.
- **Best Practice:** Consistently use `Schema.array(...)` for defining array schemas in Effect v3+.
- **Reference:** Schema fixes in `docs/logs/20250520/ignore/0850-instructions.md` and `0933-log.md`.

- **Pitfall:** Incorrectly defining `Schema.Tuple` by passing schemas as multiple arguments (e.g., `Schema.Tuple(Schema.String, Schema.Number)`) instead of a single array of schemas (e.g., `Schema.Tuple([Schema.String, Schema.Number])`).
- **Consequence:** The schema is misinterpreted, often as `readonly []` (an empty tuple), leading to type errors (e.g., "target allows only 0") when trying to decode or assign data that expects a tuple with multiple elements.
- **Best Practice:** Always pass an array of schemas as the argument to `Schema.Tuple`.
- **Reference:** `NIP90InputSchema` definition fix in `src/services/nip90/NIP90Service.ts` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1016-instructions.md).

- **Pitfall:** Attempting to directly mutate properties of objects that have been decoded using `effect/Schema`.
- **Consequence:** TypeScript errors (TS2540: Cannot assign to '...' because it is a read-only property).
- **Best Practice:** Treat objects decoded by `effect/Schema` as immutable. If modifications are needed, create a new object using the spread syntax (e.g., `const newObj = { ...decodedObj, propertyToChange: newValue };`).
- **Reference:** Handling of `NIP90JobResult` in `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/0850-instructions.md, 0933-log.md).

## 2. Electron-Specific Issues

### 2.1. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

- **Pitfall:** Making direct HTTP requests from the renderer process to local servers (like Ollama) that may not have permissive CORS headers.
- **Consequence:** CORS preflight errors (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` issues) blocking the requests.
- **Best Practice:** For Electron applications, proxy such requests through the main process using IPC. The main process (Node.js environment) does not have the same CORS restrictions for requests to `localhost`.
- **Reference:** The fix for Ollama API calls in `docs/logs/20250520/2155-ipc-fix.md`.

- **Pitfall:** IPC handlers in the main process not being registered before the renderer process attempts to invoke them.
- **Consequence:** Renderer receives an error like `"Error: No handler registered for 'channel-name'"`.
- **Best Practice:**
  1.  Register IPC handlers (`ipcMain.handle`, `ipcMain.on`) as early as feasible in `src/main.ts`.
  2.  If handlers depend on service layers (especially those using Node.js platform features like `NodeHttpClient`), ensure these layers are initialized at a safe point in the Electron app lifecycle. This often means defining the layer _inside_ the handler registration function which is itself called after `app.whenReady()`.
- **Reference:** Fixes for the `'ollama:status-check'` handler in `docs/logs/20250520/2202-instructions.md` and `2203-fix-ipc-timing.md`.

### 2.2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **Pitfall:** The CSP defined in `index.html` being too restrictive and not allowing connections to necessary local or remote origins.
- **Consequence:** Connection errors in the renderer, even if CORS would otherwise permit the request.
- **Best Practice:** Ensure the `connect-src` directive (and others like `script-src` for WASM/`unsafe-eval` if needed) in the CSP meta tag in `index.html` includes all required origins.
- **Reference:** Adding `http://localhost:11434` for Ollama in `index.html` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/2126-log.md).

## 3. TypeScript and Coding Conventions

### 3.1. Strict Adherence to Logging and Telemetry Rules

- **Pitfall:** Using `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, `console.error()`, etc., directly for application-level diagnostics, event tracking, or error reporting.
- **Consequence:**
  - Bypasses the centralized `TelemetryService`.
  - Makes production monitoring and debugging difficult.
  - Can lead to console pollution during development if not meticulously removed.
  - Violates a core project convention.
- **Best Practice:**
  - **ALL application-level logging, event tracking, warnings, and errors MUST use `TelemetryService.trackEvent(...)`.**
  - `console.*` calls are permissible ONLY for _temporary, local debugging_ during development and **MUST be removed** before committing code.
  - **Exceptions** (where `console.*` is allowed, typically marked with `// TELEMETRY_IGNORE_THIS_CONSOLE_CALL`):
    - Internal operational logging within `TelemetryServiceImpl.ts` itself.
    - Fallback `.catch()` blocks when an attempt to call `TelemetryService.trackEvent()` itself fails.
    - Test environment setup files (e.g., `src/tests/vitest.setup.ts`).
- **Reference:** `docs/AGENTS.md#11-logging-and-telemetry` and `docs/TELEMETRY.md`.

### 3.2. Avoiding `any` Casts and `this` Misuse

- **Pitfall:** Using `as any` to bypass TypeScript errors or `function(this: any)` annotations for `this` context.
- **Consequence:** Loss of type safety, potential for runtime errors that TypeScript could have caught, harder-to-maintain code.
- **Best Practice:**
  - Strive to eliminate all `as any` casts by correctly typing variables, function parameters, and return values.
  - Refactor functions to use lexical scope for closures (e.g., arrow functions or nested functions that capture variables from their outer scope) instead of relying on `this` that might be implicitly `any`.
- **Reference:** Refactoring of `checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatuses` in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts` to avoid `this` issues (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1519-instructions.md).

### 3.3. Handling External API/SDK Constraints and Errors

- **Pitfall:** Not being aware of, or incorrectly handling, specific constraints or error patterns of external libraries or APIs (e.g., Spark SDK account number validation, Ollama API headers).
- **Consequence:** Unexpected runtime errors originating from the SDK/API, which can be hard to debug if not properly mapped to application-specific errors.
- **Best Practice:**
  - Carefully consult the documentation for any external SDKs or APIs being used.
  - Implement validation for inputs passed to SDKs based on their documented constraints.
  - Wrap SDK calls in `Effect.tryPromise` (or similar) and map SDK-specific errors to your application's custom typed errors (e.g., `SparkConfigError`, `OllamaHttpError`). This provides a consistent error handling boundary.
  - Log detailed raw errors from SDKs via `TelemetryService` (especially in `catch` blocks before re-throwing a mapped error) to aid in debugging external issues.
- **Reference:**
  - Spark SDK account number constraint (must be >= 2) identified via telemetry (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1249-log.md).
  - Ollama API rejecting `traceparent` header, fixed by modifying `HttpClient` behavior (docs/logs/20250520/2145-instructions.md).

## 4. Testing Practices

### 4.1. Mocking `Effect` Library (Anti-Pattern)

- **Pitfall:** Attempting to mock the entire `effect` library or its core modules like `Schema` or `Layer` using `vi.mock('effect', ...)`.
- **Consequence:** This is highly problematic and often leads to `TypeError`s in tests (e.g., `Schema.array is not a function`, `Layer.effect is not a function`) because the mock is incomplete or incorrect. It also makes tests brittle and less representative of actual runtime behavior.
- **Best Practice:** **Do NOT mock the `effect` library itself.**
  - **For service unit tests (e.g., `NIP90Service.test.ts`):** Mock the _dependencies_ of the service being tested. Provide these mocks using `Layer.succeed(DependencyServiceTag, mockImplementation)`. Ensure the methods in your mock implementations return Effects with `R = never` (i.e., they are self-contained or their own dependencies are already satisfied within the mock).
  - **For component unit tests (e.g., `Nip90RequestForm.test.tsx`):** Mock the _services_ that the component consumes. This is often done by mocking `getMainRuntime()` to return a test-specific runtime that has been built with layers providing these mocked services.
- **Reference:** The fix for `Nip90RequestForm.test.tsx` involving removing `vi.mock('effect', ...)` and instead providing a mocked runtime/services (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/0933-instructions.md, 0957-log.md).

### 4.2. Vitest Mock Initialization Order (`vi.mock`)

- **Pitfall:** `vi.mock` calls are hoisted by Vitest. If the mock factory function (the second argument to `vi.mock`) uses variables defined in the test file, those variables might be `undefined` at the time the mock factory is executed due to hoisting.
- **Consequence:** `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variableName' before initialization` within the test setup.
- **Best Practice:** Ensure all variables used inside a `vi.mock` factory function are defined _before_ the `vi.mock` call itself in the test file. This usually means placing helper constants or mock implementation objects used by the factory at the very top of the test file, or using `vi.doMock` for more control if hoisting is an issue.
- **Reference:** Fix for `testRuntime` initialization in `Nip90RequestForm.test.tsx` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/0957-instructions.md, 1016-log.md).

## 5. State Management (Zustand)

### 5.1. Accessing Default Configuration for Stores

- **Pitfall:** Incorrectly attempting to access default configuration values from an `Effect.Layer` object (e.g., `DefaultConfigLayer.context._unsafeGet(...)`) at the module's top level for initializing a Zustand store's default state.
- **Consequence:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_unsafeGet')` because the layer's context is not available this way.
- **Best Practice:**
  1.  Define the plain JavaScript default configuration object as an exported constant in the same file where the default `Layer` is defined (e.g., in `src/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMService.ts`, export `defaultKind5050DVMServiceConfigObject`).
  2.  The `Default...Layer` should then use this exported object: `Layer.succeed(Tag, defaultKind5050DVMServiceConfigObject)`.
  3.  The Zustand store (e.g., `dvmSettingsStore.ts`) should import this exported default configuration object directly for its initial state or fallback values, not the Layer object.
- **Reference:** Fix for `dvmSettingsStore.ts` and `DVMSettingsDialog.tsx` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1532-instructions.md, 1532-log.md).

### 5.2. Initial Pane Layout Definition

- **Pitfall:** UI components (like `HomePage.tsx`) trying to manage the initial layout of panes (e.g., which panes are open, their default positions/sizes) using `useEffect` hooks and store actions, potentially conflicting with the store's own declared `initialState`.
- **Consequence:** Can lead to inconsistent initial UI states, race conditions between component effects and store hydration, or multiple sources of truth for layout.
- **Best Practice:** The `initialState` (or a `getInitialPanes()` function that populates it) within the pane store (`usePaneStore` in `src/stores/pane.ts`) should be the single source of truth for the default layout. UI components should generally not attempt to programmatically set up the initial layout on mount if the store already defines it. The `persist` middleware's `merge` function can also be used to ensure a valid default layout if persisted state is corrupted or missing critical elements.
- **Reference:** Refactoring of initial pane layout for "Sell Compute" and "Welcome Chat" into `src/stores/pane.ts` (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1537-instructions.md, 1537-log.md).

## 6. Understanding and Implementing Specifications

### 6.1. NIP (Nostr Implementation Possibilities) Details

- **Pitfall:** Misinterpreting or incompletely implementing the details of NIP specifications (e.g., NIP-04 encryption for DVM requests, correct NIP-90 event structure and kinds, NIP-28 message encryption targeting the channel creator).
- **Consequence:** Features not working as expected, interoperability issues with other Nostr clients/services, potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., incorrect encryption).
- **Best Practice:**
  1.  Thoroughly read and continuously refer to the relevant NIP documents (provided in `docs/nips/`).
  2.  Pay close attention to required event kinds, tag structures (e.g., NIP-90 `i` tags, NIP-28 `e` tags), content formatting, and specified encryption/signing mechanisms.
  3.  Use helper functions (like `createNip90JobRequest`, `decryptNip04Content`) that encapsulate protocol details to ensure consistency.
- **Reference:**
  - NIP-04 encryption logic for DVM requests, including handling unencrypted broadcasts and target DVM public key validation (docs/logs/20250520/2333-instructions.md).
  - Correctly defining `NIP90InputSchema` to match the NIP-90 specification for 'i' tags (docs/logs/20250520/ignore/1016-instructions.md for schema fix).
  - Ensuring NIP-28 messages are encrypted to the channel creator's public key (as per `NIP28ServiceImpl.ts`).

By adhering to these best practices and learning from these common pitfalls, future agent development on OpenAgents Commander will be more robust and efficient.
