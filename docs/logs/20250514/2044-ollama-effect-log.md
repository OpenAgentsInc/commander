# Implementation Log: Ollama Effect Service

## Overview

This log documents the implementation of the OllamaService using Effect-TS as specified in `2044-ollama-effect-instructions.md`. The goal is to create an Effect-TS based service for interacting with Ollama's OpenAI-compatible completion API.

## Implementation Steps (Complete)

1. Created directory structure for our service:

   - `/src/services/ollama/` for the service implementation
   - `/src/tests/unit/services/ollama/` for the tests
   - `/src/tests/mocks/` for MSW handlers

2. Installed required dependencies:

   - effect
   - @effect/platform
   - @effect/schema
   - @effect/platform-node
   - msw (for mock web server in tests)

3. Implemented core service interface in `/src/services/ollama/OllamaService.ts` with:

   - Type definitions for requests/responses
   - Custom error types (OllamaError, OllamaHttpError, OllamaParseError)
   - Effect-based service interface with strong typing

4. Created MSW mock handlers in `/src/tests/mocks/handlers.ts` and `/src/tests/mocks/server.ts` to simulate Ollama API responses:

   - Success responses
   - 404 errors (model not found)
   - 500 errors (server error)
   - Malformed JSON responses
   - Network errors

5. Implemented service with `/src/services/ollama/OllamaServiceImpl.ts` using Effect.gen and proper error handling

6. Created tests in `/src/tests/unit/services/ollama/OllamaService.test.ts` with a custom helper for testing Effect errors

## Difficulties Encountered and Solutions

The main difficulties involved handling errors with Effect-TS:

1. **Type Safety vs Runtime Error Handling**:

   - Problem: TypeScript type checking was passing but tests failed because Effect wraps errors
   - Solution: Used proper Effect error handling with mapError to ensure error types match the interface

2. **FiberFailure Wrapping**:

   - Problem: Effect wraps errors in FiberFailure objects, making instanceof checks fail
   - Solution: Created a custom `expectEffectFailure` helper that uses Effect.flip and filtering

3. **Error Flow in Effect Chains**:

   - Problem: try/catch blocks didn't work well with Effect generator syntax
   - Solution: Used Effect.tryPromise with mapError to properly handle errors in the chain

4. **UnknownException vs Custom Errors**:

   - Problem: The service was throwing UnknownException in some cases
   - Solution: Used consistent Effect.pipe(Effect.mapError()) pattern to ensure error types are preserved

5. **Testing Effect Errors**:
   - Problem: Standard testing approaches didn't work with Effect's error handling
   - Solution: Created a utility that extracts and validates errors from Effect failures

## Final Implementation

### Service Interface

- Strong typing with Effect.Effect for return values
- Custom error hierarchy with OllamaHttpError and OllamaParseError
- Clear separation of concerns with domain-specific errors

### Implementation

- Pure Effect-based implementation using Effect.gen and proper pipe/mapError patterns
- No try/catch blocks that might lead to UnknownException
- Consistent error propagation and typing

### Testing

- Custom helper for testing Effect failures
- All test cases passing for success and error scenarios
- Tests for network errors, API errors, and parsing errors

## Conclusion

We successfully implemented the OllamaService using Effect-TS, with proper error handling and tests. The implementation follows functional programming principles and leverages Effect's type safety.

The service now provides a robust interface for making API calls to Ollama, with proper error handling and clear, typed results.

All typechecks and tests are now passing.
