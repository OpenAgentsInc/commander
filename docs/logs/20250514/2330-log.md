# Refactoring `OllamaService` to use `@effect/platform/HttpClient`

## Overview
This log documents the refactoring process of replacing direct `fetch` API calls in `OllamaServiceImpl.ts` with Effect's `HttpClient` service. This is the final phase of refactoring the `OllamaService` to fully embrace Effect's dependency injection and functional approach.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Current Implementation

Current implementation uses `fetch` directly in the `OllamaServiceImpl.ts` file. The service is already using Effect's Schema for validation and the tests are already using Layer-based testing.

Key files involved:
- `src/services/ollama/OllamaService.ts` - Service interface and schemas
- `src/services/ollama/OllamaServiceImpl.ts` - Implementation with fetch
- `src/tests/unit/services/ollama/OllamaService.test.ts` - Tests
- `src/tests/unit/services/ollama/TestHttpClient.ts` - Test utilities for mocking fetch

### 2. Exploring the HttpClient API

The HttpClient API from `@effect/platform` had some API differences from what was expected. I examined the available modules and types to understand the correct approach:

- `HttpClient` - Contains the HttpClient interface and tag for dependency injection
- `HttpClientRequest` - For creating and configuring HTTP requests
- `HttpClientResponse` - For handling HTTP responses
- `HttpBody` - For creating request bodies
- `HttpClientError` - For handling HTTP errors

### 3. Refactoring OllamaServiceImpl.ts

Implemented the following changes:
1. Updated imports to include `HttpClient`, `HttpClientRequest`, `HttpBody`
2. Modified `OllamaServiceLive` to depend on `HttpClient` Tag
3. Updated `createOllamaService` to accept `httpClient` parameter
4. Replaced `fetch` with `httpClient.execute` and used HttpClient APIs
5. Adapted error handling to work with HttpClient's error types
6. Used body creation via `HttpBody.text` 
7. Adapted response parsing to work with HttpClient response object

Changes:
```typescript
// Using HttpClient
const response = yield* _(
    httpClient.execute(httpRequest),
    Effect.mapError(httpClientError => {
        return new OllamaHttpError(
            `HTTP request failed: ${httpClientError._tag || "Unknown error"}`,
            finalRequestBody,
            httpClientError
        );
    })
);

// Parse response text
const responseText = yield* _(
    Effect.try(() => response.text),
    Effect.flatMap(textEffect => textEffect),
    Effect.mapError(e => new OllamaParseError("Failed to parse success response", e))
);
```

### 4. Refactoring TestHttpClient.ts

Created a mock implementation of `HttpClient` instead of mocking global `fetch`:

1. Defined a mock HttpClient that matches the interface
2. Created helper functions to set mock responses using `setMockClientResponse`
3. Updated the layer to provide mock HttpClient via `Layer.succeed(HttpClient, TestHttpClientImpl)`

```typescript
const TestHttpClientImpl: HttpClient = {
  execute: (request) => {
    const url = request.url;
    const method = request.method;
    const key = makeRequestKey({ url, method });
    
    const mockResponse = mockResponses.get(key);
    
    if (!mockResponse) {
      return Effect.fail(new HttpClientError.RequestError({
        request,
        reason: "Other",
        error: new Error(`No mock response found for ${method} ${url}`)
      }));
    }
    
    return mockResponse;
  },
  // ... other required methods
};
```

### 5. Updating Tests

Modified the tests to work with the new `HttpClient`-based implementation:

1. Created a `createMockResponse` helper to construct mock HttpClientResponse objects
2. Updated test setup with `TestHttpClientLive` layer
3. Used `setMockClientResponse` to set mock responses
4. Ensured all mocked responses match the HttpClientResponse interface
5. Fixed JSON parsing handling in the mock responses

### 6. Validating the Refactoring

All tests are now passing with the HttpClient-based implementation. The service is fully using Effect's dependency injection system and functional approach.

## Conclusion

The refactoring to use `@effect/platform/HttpClient` is complete. The code now follows Effect's patterns more closely, using its dependency injection, error handling, and HTTP client abstractions.

Key benefits:
- No direct use of global `fetch` API
- More testable through Effect's Layer system
- Strong error typing and handling
- Schema validation for request and response data
- Clean separation of concerns with functional patterns

The refactoring required some adaptation of the original approach due to differences in the actual API compared to what was expected, but the final result achieves the goal of using Effect's abstractions consistently throughout the codebase.
