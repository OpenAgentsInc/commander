# Refactoring `OllamaService` to use `@effect/platform/HttpClient`

## Overview
This log documents the refactoring process of replacing direct `fetch` API calls in `OllamaServiceImpl.ts` with Effect's `HttpClient` service. This is the final phase of refactoring the `OllamaService` to fully embrace Effect's dependency injection and functional approach.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Current Implementation

Current implementation uses `fetch` directly in the `OllamaServiceImpl.ts` file. The service is already using Effect's Schema for validation and the tests are already using Layer-based testing.

Key files involved:
- `src/services/ollama/OllamaService.ts` - Service interface and schemas
- `src/services/ollama/OllamaServiceImpl.ts` - Implementation with fetch
- `src/tests/unit/services/ollama/OllamaService.test.ts` - Tests
- `src/tests/unit/services/ollama/TestHttpClient.ts` - Test utilities for mocking fetch

### 2. Exploring the HttpClient API

The HttpClient API from `@effect/platform` had some API differences from what was expected. I examined the available modules and types to understand the correct approach:

- `HttpClient` - Contains the HttpClient interface and tag for dependency injection
- `HttpClientRequest` - For creating and configuring HTTP requests
- `HttpClientResponse` - For handling HTTP responses
- `HttpBody` - For creating request bodies
- `HttpClientError` - For handling HTTP errors

Key aspects of the API:
- The `HttpClient` is a Tag, and type `HttpClient` represents the service interface
- Response methods like `json` and `text` are accessed directly on the response object, not as module functions
- The complex type structure requires careful handling for mocks

### 3. Fixing Type Issues

One of the main challenges was dealing with TypeScript errors. Key fixes include:

1. Importing the service type alias: `import type { HttpClient as HttpClientService } from "@effect/platform/HttpClient"`
2. Using proper typing in `createOllamaService`:
   ```typescript
   export function createOllamaService(
       config: OllamaServiceConfig,
       httpClient: HttpClientService
   ): OllamaService {
   ```
3. Adding explicit return type to avoid type inference issues:
   ```typescript
   const generateChatCompletion = (requestBody: unknown): Effect.Effect<OllamaChatCompletionResponse, OllamaHttpError | OllamaParseError, never> => {
   ```
4. Using property-based access for response methods instead of namespace functions:
   ```typescript
   // Correct way to access json property
   const json = yield* _(
       response.json,
       Effect.mapError(e => new OllamaParseError("Failed to parse success JSON response", e))
   );
   ```
5. Creating a proper HttpClient mock implementation with type cast:
   ```typescript
   export const TestHttpClientLive = Layer.succeed(
     HttpClient, 
     createMockClient() as unknown as HttpClient
   );
   ```

### 4. Refactoring OllamaServiceImpl.ts

Implemented the following changes:
1. Updated imports to include `HttpClient`, `HttpClientRequest`, `HttpBody`
2. Modified `OllamaServiceLive` to depend on `HttpClient` Tag
3. Updated `createOllamaService` to accept `httpClient` parameter
4. Replaced `fetch` with `httpClient.execute` and used HttpClient APIs
5. Adapted error handling to work with HttpClient's error types
6. Used body creation via `HttpBody.text` 
7. Adapted response parsing to work with HttpClient response object

Changes:
```typescript
// Create HTTP request using HttpClient
const body = yield* _(
    Effect.tryPromise({
        try: () => Promise.resolve(HttpBody.text(JSON.stringify(finalRequestBody), "application/json")),
        catch: error => new OllamaParseError(
            `Failed to create request body: ${String(error)}`,
            error
        )
    })
);

// Then create the request with the body
const httpRequest = HttpClientRequest.post(url).pipe(
    HttpClientRequest.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"),
    HttpClientRequest.setBody(body)
);

// Execute the request
const response = yield* _(
    httpClient.execute(httpRequest),
    Effect.mapError(httpClientError => 
        new OllamaHttpError(
            `HTTP request failed: ${httpClientError._tag || "Unknown error"}`,
            httpRequest,
            httpClientError
        )
    )
);

// Access json method directly on the response object
const json = yield* _(
    response.json,
    Effect.mapError(e => new OllamaParseError("Failed to parse success JSON response", e))
);
```

### 5. Refactoring TestHttpClient.ts

Created a mock implementation of `HttpClient` instead of mocking global `fetch`:

1. Created a mock client factory that implements the interface
2. Implemented `setMockClientResponse` and `clearMockClientResponses` functions
3. Created a Layer that provides the mock client:
   ```typescript
   export const TestHttpClientLive = Layer.succeed(
     HttpClient, 
     createMockClient() as unknown as HttpClient
   );
   ```
4. Used proper error creation:
   ```typescript
   return Effect.fail(new HttpClientError.RequestError({
     request,
     reason: "Transport", // Must use one of the allowed reasons
     cause: new Error("Network error")
   }));
   ```

### 6. Updating Tests

Modified the tests to work with the new `HttpClient`-based implementation:

1. Added helper to create proper HttpClientResponse objects:
   ```typescript
   function mockHttpClientResponse(
       status: number,
       body: any,
       contentType: string = 'application/json'
   ): HttpClientResponse.HttpClientResponse {
       const mockRequest = HttpClientRequest.get("http://mock-url");
       const responseText = typeof body === 'string' ? body : JSON.stringify(body);
       const response = new Response(responseText, {
           status,
           headers: { 'Content-Type': contentType }
       });
       return HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(mockRequest, response);
   }
   ```
2. Updated tests to use this helper for creating responses:
   ```typescript
   Effect.runSync(
       setMockClientResponse(
           { url: `${testConfig.baseURL}/chat/completions`, method: "POST" },
           Effect.succeed(mockHttpClientResponse(200, mockOllamaResponse))
       )
   );
   ```

### 7. Validating the Refactoring

All tests are now passing with the HttpClient-based implementation. The service is fully using Effect's dependency injection system and functional approach.

## Conclusion

The refactoring to use `@effect/platform/HttpClient` is complete. The code now follows Effect's patterns more closely, using its dependency injection, error handling, and HTTP client abstractions.

Key benefits:
- No direct use of global `fetch` API
- More testable through Effect's Layer system
- Strong error typing and handling
- Schema validation for request and response data
- Clean separation of concerns with functional patterns

Key lessons:
- Effect-TS has a complex API with unique patterns that require careful type handling
- Understanding the exact structure of interfaces is crucial for writing compliant code
- Type casting may be necessary in some cases, especially for mock implementations
- Direct property access vs. namespace functions is an important distinction

The refactoring required some adaptation of the original approach due to differences in the actual API compared to what was expected, but the final result achieves the goal of using Effect's abstractions consistently throughout the codebase.
