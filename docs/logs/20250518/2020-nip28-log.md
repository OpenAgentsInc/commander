# NIP-28 Implementation Log

## Overview

This log documents the implementation of `NIP28Service`, an Effect-based service layer for working with [NIP-28: Public Chat](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/28.md) in our Commander application. NIP-28 defines event kinds 40-44 for public chat channels and client-side moderation features.

## Initial Research Phase

1. First, I reviewed the NIP-28 specification to understand the event kinds and their structures:

   - Kind 40: Channel Creation
   - Kind 41: Channel Metadata
   - Kind 42: Channel Message
   - Kind 43: Hide Message
   - Kind 44: Mute User

2. I examined our existing codebase to understand how we handle Nostr events:

   - Located the `NostrService` interface and implementation
   - Confirmed the service provides the necessary methods (`publishEvent` and `listEvents`)
   - Analyzed the `NostrEvent` and `NostrFilter` interfaces to ensure compatibility

3. I studied our telemetry system to ensure proper integration:
   - Reviewed the `TelemetryService` interface and implementation
   - Noted the standard categories (`feature`, `log:info`, `log:error`, etc.)
   - Determined patterns for logging events in an Effect-based service

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Service Interface (`NIP28Service.ts`)

1. Created the service interface focusing on the five core operations corresponding to NIP-28 event kinds:

   - `createChannel` (Kind 40)
   - `setChannelMetadata` (Kind 41)
   - `sendChannelMessage` (Kind 42)
   - `hideMessage` (Kind 43)
   - `muteUser` (Kind 44)

2. Added query operations to fetch events:

   - `getChannel` - Get a specific channel (Kind 40)
   - `getChannelMetadataHistory` - List channel metadata updates (Kind 41)
   - `getLatestChannelMetadata` - Get latest metadata for a channel
   - `getChannelMessages` - List messages in a channel (Kind 42)
   - `getUserHiddenMessages` - List hidden messages for a user (Kind 43)
   - `getUserMutedUsers` - List muted users for a user (Kind 44)

3. Defined parameter interfaces for each method with clear, type-safe inputs

4. Created effect schemas for validating message content:

   - `ChannelMetadataContentSchema` for kinds 40-41
   - `ModerationReasonContentSchema` for kinds 43-44

5. Defined custom error types:
   - `NIP28InvalidInputError`
   - `NIP28PublishError`
   - `NIP28FetchError`

### Phase 2: Service Implementation (`NIP28ServiceImpl.ts`)

1. Implemented the service with a factory function pattern (`createNIP28Service`)

2. Integrated with `TelemetryService` throughout:

   - Track all service method calls in the `feature` category
   - Log successes in the `log:info` category
   - Log errors in the `log:error` category

3. Created a helper function `signAndPublishEvent` to:

   - Sign the event using `finalizeEvent` from `nostr-tools/pure`
   - Publish the event using `NostrService`
   - Track telemetry at each step

4. For input validation, used Effect Schema to ensure:

   - Channel names are non-empty for Kind 40
   - At least one metadata field is provided for Kind 41
   - Message content is non-empty for Kind 42

5. Properly structured tags for each event kind following NIP-28 conventions:

   - "e" tags for channel references and replies
   - "p" tags for user references
   - "t" tags for channel categories

6. Added rich error handling throughout to provide meaningful error messages when operations fail

### Phase 3: Unit Tests (`NIP28Service.test.ts`)

1. Created comprehensive unit tests using Vitest:

   - Set up mocks for `NostrService`, `TelemetryService`, and `nostr-tools/pure`
   - Created a test layer combining mock dependencies
   - Implemented helper functions for running test effects

2. Added test cases for each public method:

   - Success path tests
   - Error path tests (invalid inputs, service failures)
   - Verification of correct event structure and content

3. Verified proper tag structures in events:

   - Verified root channel references (`["e", channelId, relayUrl, "root"]`)
   - Verified reply references (`["e", replyId, relayUrl, "reply"]`)
   - Verified user references (`["p", pubkey, relayUrl]`)

4. Tested filter creation for relay queries:
   - Verified correct filter parameters for each query method
   - Tested pagination options (limit, since, until)

## Integration Considerations

1. The service is designed to be used with the Effect.js pattern:

   ```typescript
   const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
     const nip28Service = yield* _(NIP28Service);
     const channel = yield* _(
       nip28Service.createChannel({
         name: "My Channel",
         secretKey: mySecretKey,
       }),
     );
     return channel;
   }).pipe(
     Effect.provide(NIP28ServiceLive),
     Effect.provide(NostrServiceLive),
     Effect.provide(TelemetryServiceLive),
   );
   ```

2. Error handling follows the Effect pattern, with specific error types that can be matched:
   ```typescript
   Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then((exit) => {
     Exit.match(exit, {
       onSuccess: (channel) => {
         console.log("Channel created:", channel.id);
       },
       onFailure: (cause) => {
         if (Cause.isFailType(cause, NIP28InvalidInputError)) {
           console.error("Invalid input:", Cause.failureValue(cause).message);
         } else if (Cause.isFailType(cause, NIP28PublishError)) {
           console.error("Publish error:", Cause.failureValue(cause).message);
         }
       },
     });
   });
   ```

## Testing Results

All unit tests have been implemented and are passing. The implementation handles the following test cases:

1. Channel creation and metadata updates
2. Message sending with proper root/reply references
3. Message hiding and user muting
4. Various channel and message queries

The telemetry integration has been tested to ensure all operations are properly tracked.

## Summary

The `NIP28Service` implementation provides a comprehensive, Effect-based interface for working with public chat functionality in the Nostr protocol. It follows the NIP-28 specification, integrates with our existing services, and includes full test coverage.

The service should be ready for integration into the Commander application, providing a robust foundation for building chat-related features.
