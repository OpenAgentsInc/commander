## Agent Action Analysis

The agent performed the following steps to address the issues and implement the NIP-90 event display:

1.  **Initial Setup & Dependency Checks:**
    *   Verified that `nostr-tools` and `effect` (with its ecosystem packages like `@effect/platform`, `@effect/schema`) were already in `package.json`.
    *   Created the directory `src/services/nostr/`.

2.  **NostrService Definition (`NostrService.ts`):**
    *   Defined the `NostrService` interface using Effect's `Context.GenericTag`.
    *   Specified methods: `getPool`, `listEvents`, `publishEvent`, `cleanupPool`.
    *   Defined custom error types (`NostrPoolError`, `NostrRequestError`, `NostrPublishError`) using `Data.TaggedError`.
    *   Defined `NostrServiceConfig` and `NostrServiceConfigTag` for relay list and timeouts.
    *   Provided `DefaultNostrServiceConfigLayer` with the specified relay list.
    *   Imported types from `nostr-tools/pure` and `nostr-tools/filter`. **Initially, there was a mix-up with `nostr-tools/lib/types/filter` which was later corrected to `nostr-tools/filter`.**

3.  **NostrService Implementation (`NostrServiceImpl.ts`):**
    *   Implemented `createNostrService` factory function.
    *   Managed a singleton `SimplePool` instance, initializing it in `getPoolEffect`.
        *   The `SimplePool` constructor was called with default options initially (`new SimplePool()`).
        *   Later, it was correctly updated to use `new SimplePool({ eoseSubTimeout: 5000, getTimeout: config.requestTimeoutMs / 2 });` to respect the configured timeout.
    *   Implemented `listEvents` using `pool.querySync` (corrected from `pool.list` which is not on `SimplePool`), `Effect.tryPromise`, `Effect.timeout`, and sorting.
    *   Implemented `publishEvent` using `pool.publish` and `Promise.allSettled` for robust error reporting.
    *   Implemented `cleanupPool` to close relay connections.
    *   Provided `NostrServiceLive` layer.
    *   **Error Propagation Fix:** Added `Effect.mapError` in `listEvents` and `publishEvent` to correctly map `NostrPoolError` (from `getPoolEffect`) to `NostrRequestError` or `NostrPublishError` respectively, satisfying the interface's declared error types.

4.  **NostrService Unit Tests (`NostrService.test.ts`):**
    *   Initially, tests failed with "TypeError: Effect.service is not a function" due to incorrect layer provision or runtime setup for tests.
    *   **Correction 1:** Switched to a more direct testing approach by calling `createNostrService(testConfig)` and running effects directly. This resolved the "locals" error.
    *   **Correction 2:** Addressed `toBeInstanceOf(MockedSimplePool)` failure by checking for specific properties on the mocked pool object instead.
    *   **Correction 3:** Fixed `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` being 2 by clearing mocks properly in `beforeEach` and ensuring the pool constructor was indeed called only once for memoized `getPool` calls.
    *   **Correction 4:** Fixed `mockPoolQuerySyncFn.mockResolvedValue is not a function` by correctly setting up mocks for `querySync`, `publish`, and `close` directly on the `SimplePool.prototype` or ensuring the instance used in the service is the one being mocked. The final approach involved mocking the `SimplePool` constructor to return an object with vi.fn() for its methods.
    *   The test file was updated to include a basic "should be creatable" test and then further tests for `getPool`, `listEvents`, `publishEvent`, and `cleanupPool` logic, using the direct service instance.

5.  **UI Component (`Nip90EventList.tsx`):**
    *   Created the component to fetch and display NIP-90 events.
    *   Used `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching.
    *   The `fetchNip90JobRequests` function was implemented to:
        *   Define filters for NIP-90 kinds (5000-5999).
        *   Use `NostrService` via `Effect.gen` and `yield* _(NostrServiceTag)`.
        *   Provide the `NostrServiceLive` and `DefaultNostrServiceConfigLayer`.
        *   **Error Handling Correction:** Initially, it returned an empty array on error. This was changed to use `Effect.runPromiseExit` and then `Effect.either` (then corrected to `Exit.isSuccess`/`Exit.isFailure` with `Cause.pretty` or `Cause.squash` for throwing) to properly propagate errors to `useQuery`.
    *   Used a (mocked then real) `useNip19Encoding` hook for formatting pubkeys and event IDs.
    *   Rendered events in `<Card>` components, showing kind, content, pubkey, etc.
    *   Included a "Refresh" button.
    *   Grouped events by kind.

6.  **TypeScript Fixes:**
    *   Corrected import paths for `nostr-tools/filter`.
    *   Resolved type mismatches in `HomePage.tsx` related to `useHandTracking` props.
    *   Fixed argument type for `generateMnemonic` in `HomePage.tsx`.
    *   Corrected usage of `Effect.either` and `Effect.isRight` to `Exit.isSuccess` and `Exit.isFailure` with `exit.value` or `exit.cause` in `Nip90EventList.tsx`.
    *   Ensured error types in `NostrServiceImpl.ts` matched the `NostrService.ts` interface by correctly mapping errors from `getPoolEffect`.

7.  **Console Output Analysis:**
    *   The console logs show that the `NostrService` is being initialized with the correct relays.
    *   The filters for NIP-90 kinds (5000-5999 with limit 20) are correctly constructed.
    *   The Content Security Policy (CSP) is blocking WebSocket connections to the Nostr relays. This is the primary reason no events are being fetched.
    *   MediaPipe/Hand tracking errors are also present but are separate from the Nostr issue.

**Current State:**
*   Tests (`pnpm test "NostrService"`) are passing.
*   TypeScript checks (`pnpm t`) are passing.
*   The application runs (`pnpm start`).
*   **Crucially, the NIP-90 event list UI shows "No NIP-90 job requests found."**
*   **The console log clearly indicates that WebSocket connections to the relays are being blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP).**

---

## Next Step Instructions:

The immediate blocker is the Content Security Policy (CSP) preventing WebSocket connections (`wss://`). We need to update the CSP to allow these connections.

**1. Modify Content Security Policy in `index.html`:**

*   **File:** `index.html`
*   **Task:** Update the `connect-src` directive in the `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to include `wss:`.
*   **Current `connect-src` (example from provided files):**
    `connect-src 'self' blob: https://raw.githack.com https://*.pmndrs.com https://raw.githubusercontent.com;`
*   **Change to:**
    Append `wss:` to the `connect-src` list. If you want to be more specific and only allow your list of relays, you can list them individually, but `wss:` is a good general start for WebSocket connections.
    A more permissive (but still reasonably secure) version would be:
    `connect-src 'self' blob: https: wss:;`
    This allows connections to any HTTPS and WSS endpoint.
    Or, to be more specific to the relays you use:
    `connect-src 'self' blob: https: wss://purplepag.es/ wss://nos.lol/ wss://relay.damus.io/ wss://relay.snort.social/ wss://offchain.pub/ wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/ https://raw.githack.com https://*.pmndrs.com https://raw.githubusercontent.com;`
    (Note: Ensure all your current `connect-src` domains are retained).

    **Recommended Change for `connect-src`:**
    Start with the more general `wss:` to ensure it works, then you can tighten it if needed.
    Modify the `meta` tag in `index.html`:
    ```html
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' blob: https: wss:; img-src 'self' data: blob: https://raw.githack.com https://*.pmndrs.com https://raw.githubusercontent.com" />
    ```

**2. Verify Relay Connections and Event Fetching:**

*   **Action:** Run `pnpm start`.
*   **Check Console:**
    *   The "Refused to connect to '<URL>' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive" errors should be gone for the `wss://` relays.
    *   You should see console logs from `NostrServiceImpl.ts` indicating successful (or attempted) connections and event fetching.
    *   Specifically, `[Nostr] Fetched X events` should now hopefully show `X > 0`.
*   **Check UI:**
    *   The "NIP-90 Job Requests" list should now populate with events if any are found on the relays matching the kinds 5000-5999 and limit 20.
    *   If it still shows "No NIP-90 job requests found," check the console for any errors from `NostrService` or `Nip90EventList.tsx` (`fetchNip90JobRequests` function). Potential issues could be:
        *   Relays are temporarily down or not responding within the timeout.
        *   No recent NIP-90 events of kinds 5000-5999 on those relays.
        *   An error within the `pool.querySync` promise that wasn't caught as expected.

**3. Debugging if No Events Appear (after CSP fix):**

*   **Increase `limit` in `Nip90EventList.tsx`:**
    *   Temporarily increase the `limit` in the `filters` from `20` to a larger number (e.g., `100` or `200`) to see if older events are fetched. Some relays might not have very recent NIP-90 traffic.
    ```typescript
    // src/components/nip90/Nip90EventList.tsx
    const filters: NostrFilter[] = [{
      kinds: nip90RequestKinds,
      limit: 100 // Increased limit
    }];
    ```
*   **Check Relay Behavior:**
    *   Use a Nostr client (like an web client such as nostrudel.ninja, snort.social, or iris.to) to manually query one or two of the relays from your list for kinds 5000-5999 to confirm they are serving such events.
*   **Log Raw Events:**
    *   In `Nip90EventList.tsx`, inside `fetchNip90JobRequests` after successfully fetching events, add a `console.log(JSON.stringify(events, null, 2));` to inspect the raw event data received from the relays before any UI processing. This helps verify the data structure.
*   **Test `SimplePool` directly (small scale):**
    *   If issues persist, you can create a very small, temporary test script (e.g., in `HomePage.tsx`'s `useEffect` or a test button) that uses `SimplePool` directly (not through the Effect service) to fetch events. This can help isolate if the issue is in the service wrapping or `nostr-tools` itself.

        ```typescript
        // Example temporary test in HomePage.tsx
        useEffect(() => {
          const testPool = async () => {
            const pool = new SimplePool();
            const relays = ["wss://relay.damus.io/"]; // Test with one reliable relay
            const filter = [{ kinds: [5000], limit: 5 }];
            try {
              console.log("[Temp Test] Querying relay directly...");
              const events = await pool.querySync(relays, filter[0], {maxWait: 5000});
              console.log("[Temp Test] Direct pool query result:", events);
              pool.close(relays);
            } catch (e) {
              console.error("[Temp Test] Direct pool query error:", e);
              pool.close(relays);
            }
          };
          // testPool(); // Uncomment to run this test
        }, []);
        ```

**Log your steps and observations in `docs/logs/20250518/0117-nip90-log.md` (continue the existing log file).** Focus on:
*   The CSP change.
*   Whether the "Refused to connect" errors disappear.
*   Whether events are fetched and displayed, or if new errors appear.
*   Any debugging steps taken if events are still not showing.

This should move you closer to displaying actual NIP-90 events. The CSP is the most likely culprit for "0 events fetched" given the console logs.
