# NIP-90 Consolidated Implementation Log

I'll be implementing a NIP-90 job request form UI as outlined in the instructions document. This will allow users to create and publish NIP-90 job requests to Nostr relays.

## Step 1: Create the form test and component

First, I've created the test file for the form component in `/src/tests/unit/components/nip90/Nip90RequestForm.test.tsx`. This includes:
- Basic test for rendering the form with all required fields
- Test for form state updates when inputs change

The test includes mocks for:
- nostr-tools/pure library functions (generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, finalizeEvent)
- NostrService for testing the form submission

Next, I implemented the Nip90RequestForm component in `/src/components/nip90/Nip90RequestForm.tsx`. This component:
- Uses Shadcn UI components for the form elements
- Manages form state with React useState hooks
- Includes validation for form fields
- Has UI feedback for loading, success, and error states
- Uses the Effect.js library to interact with the NostrService

I also updated the `/src/components/nip90/index.ts` file to export the new component.

## Step 2: Implement the NIP-90 event creation helper function

Created a utility function to construct NIP-90 job request events:
- Implemented `createNip90JobRequest` in `/src/helpers/nip90/event_creation.ts`
- This function handles:
  - Setting the correct event kind (5000-5999)
  - Creating the appropriate tags (`i`, `output`, `bid`)
  - Finalizing and signing the event using nostr-tools

Added tests for this helper function in `/src/tests/unit/helpers/nip90/event_creation.test.ts`:
- Tests creating a valid NIP-90 job request with all parameters
- Tests handling of optional bid parameter (undefined or zero)

## Step 3: Add form submission tests

Enhanced the tests for our form component to verify submission functionality:
- Added test for successful form submission that verifies:
  - The form calls the generateSecretKey function from nostr-tools
  - It correctly calls NostrService.publishEvent with the properly constructed event
  - It displays a success message with the event ID
- Added tests for error handling:
  - Field validation errors (e.g., empty input data)
  - Publishing errors from the NostrService
  
These tests use mocks and the Effect.Provider to inject a test version of the NostrService.

## Step 4: Integrate the form into HomePage

Integrated the NIP-90 Request Form into the application UI:
- Updated the HomePage component to import the Nip90RequestForm
- Modified the right panel layout to include both the form and event list
- Added a flex column layout with gap to separate the form and list
- Ensured the event list still expands to fill available space with `flex-grow`
- Added proper styling to maintain the app's aesthetic (backdrop blur, rounded corners, etc.)

## Summary

The implementation of the NIP-90 job request form is now complete. Users can now:

1. Fill out a form with job details including:
   - Job Kind (5000-5999)
   - Input Data
   - Output MIME Type
   - Optional Bid Amount (in msats)

2. Submit the form to create and publish a NIP-90 job request to Nostr relays

3. View feedback on the publication process:
   - Loading indicator during publishing
   - Success message with event ID when published successfully
   - Error messages for validation or publishing failures

The form is displayed in the right panel above the existing NIP-90 event list. The implementation follows Effect.js patterns for interacting with services and uses the project's UI component library (Shadcn UI) for consistent styling.

The form automatically generates an ephemeral key pair for each job request to maintain privacy and security when publishing events.

This implementation completes the primary goal of allowing users to create and publish NIP-90 job requests through the UI.
