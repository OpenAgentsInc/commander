# NIP04 Service Implementation Log

## Overview
This log documents the process of implementing the `NIP04Service` and integrating it with the existing NIP-90 functionality.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define NIP04Service interface and error types
2. Implement NIP04Service
3. Create unit tests for NIP04Service
4. Refactor NIP-90 helpers to use NIP04Service
5. Update tests for NIP-90 helpers and components

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Define NIP04Service Interface and Types
✅ Created `src/services/nip04/NIP04Service.ts` with:
  - Custom error types for encryption and decryption operations
  - Service interface with encrypt and decrypt methods
  - Context tag for dependency injection using Effect.js

### Phase 2: Implement NIP04Service
✅ Created `src/services/nip04/NIP04ServiceImpl.ts` with:
  - Implementation of NIP04Service interface
  - Effect.tryPromise for handling async encryption/decryption operations
  - Live Layer for dependency injection

✅ Created `src/services/nip04/index.ts` for exporting the service components

### Phase 3: Unit Test NIP04Service
✅ Created `src/tests/unit/services/nip04/NIP04Service.test.ts` with:
  - Tests for successful encryption and decryption
  - Tests for handling encryption and decryption errors
  - Mocks for the underlying nostr-tools/nip04 functionality
