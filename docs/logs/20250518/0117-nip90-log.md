# NIP-90 Implementation Log

## Initial Analysis

I'm working on fixing the NostrService implementation and tests. The main issues appear to be:

1. Layer composition issues in the tests, causing the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locals')"
2. Need to improve the integration of the NostrService with the UI component

Based on the followup instructions, I'll start with simplifying the tests.

## Fixing NostrService.test.ts

I've examined the current implementation of the test file. Here's what I've found:

1. The current test is quite minimal, only checking if the service is defined and has expected methods
2. The test uses `Effect.provide` with layer composition: `NostrServiceLive.pipe(Effect.provide(DefaultNostrServiceConfigLayer))`
3. This layer composition appears to be causing the issue with the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locals')"

According to the followup instructions, I need to simplify the test by:
- Directly instantiating the service with a test config
- Using `Effect.runPromise` to execute the effect
- Adding more comprehensive tests for each service method

The NostrService implementation appears sound otherwise, with:
- SimplePool initialization
- Events fetching with timeout handling
- Event publishing
- Pool cleanup

The Nip90EventList component also needs improvement in its error handling. Currently, it:
- Fetches data using the NostrService via Effect
- Returns empty array on error instead of throwing
- Displays fetched events grouped by kind

I'll make the necessary changes to both files according to the followup instructions.

## Implementation

### 1. Updated NostrService.test.ts

I've restructured the NostrService test file to:

- Use direct instantiation of the service with `createNostrService(testConfig)` instead of using layer composition
- Set up proper mocking for SimplePool and its methods
- Implement comprehensive tests for all service methods (getPool, listEvents, publishEvent, cleanupPool)
- Use `Effect.runPromise()` to run the effects directly

Key changes:
- Added proper initialization of mock functions in the beforeEach block
- Created tests for pool instance reuse
- Added tests for event sorting in listEvents
- Added basic tests for event publishing and pool cleanup

This simpler approach avoids the complex layer composition that was causing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locals')" error.

### 2. Updated Nip90EventList.tsx

I've improved the error handling in the fetchNip90JobRequests function:

- Removed the try/catch block that was swallowing errors
- Added `Effect.runPromiseExit()` to properly handle success and failure cases
- Used `Effect.isSuccess()` to check the exit status
- Added proper error reporting with `Effect.pretty()` to format error causes
- Made sure errors are thrown rather than returning empty arrays, which enables React Query's error handling

These changes should allow for better error visibility in the UI and more accurate debugging when relay connections fail.

## Test Fixes

I encountered several issues when running the tests:

1. First attempt: `toBeInstanceOf(MockedSimplePool)` failed because the mock instance is not actually an instance of the mocked class.
   - Fixed by checking for properties instead (`toHaveProperty('querySync')`, etc.)

2. Second attempt: `MockedSimplePool.toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` failed because it was being called twice.
   - This was due to an issue with our beforeEach block creating a second instance

3. Third attempt: `mockPoolQuerySyncFn.mockResolvedValue()` failed with "Cannot read property 'mockResolvedValue' of undefined"
   - The mock references were not being correctly set up

Final solution:
- Simplified the mock setup by defining mock functions at the top level
- Used vi.mock with mockImplementation to return a consistent mock object
- Directly accessed these mock functions in the tests
- Ensured proper clearing of mocks between tests with `vi.clearAllMocks()`

Now all tests are passing, validating that:
- The pool instance is created and reused correctly
- Events are fetched and sorted properly
- Events can be published to relays
- Pool connections can be cleaned up

The simplified approach avoids the complex layer composition that was causing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locals')" error.

## TypeScript Fixes

After fixing the tests, I encountered several TypeScript errors that needed to be resolved:

1. In Nip90EventList.tsx:
   - Changed from `Effect.runPromiseExit` to `Effect.runPromise(Effect.either(...))` for better type safety
   - Added `Either` import from effect
   - Used `Either.isRight` instead of `Effect.isRight`
   - Fixed property access for either type (right/left)

2. In NostrServiceImpl.ts:
   - Fixed error handling to ensure consistent error types across service methods
   - Added `Effect.mapError` to map NostrPoolError to appropriate error types in each method
   - Fixed type errors related to getPool returning `NostrPoolError` but methods declaring only `NostrRequestError` or `NostrPublishError`

All type errors are now resolved, and the tests continue to pass. These changes ensure:
- Type-safe error handling across the entire service
- Proper error information propagation to the UI
- Consistent error mapping between different error types
