# Chat Window Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a new chat window interface for the Commander application, positioned at the bottom-left of the screen according to the HUD design requirements. This chat window displays the conversation history between the user and the agent, and includes an input area for sending new messages.

## Components Created

### 1. ChatMessage Component
- Created a reusable component for displaying individual chat messages
- Supports different message roles (user, assistant, system)
- Includes timestamp display
- Applies different styling based on message role
- File: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`

### 2. ChatWindow Component
- Contains the full chat interface including:
  - Message history with scrolling capability
  - Auto-scroll to latest messages
  - Text input area with textarea
  - Send button
- Handles keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)
- Shows loading state during API calls
- File: `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`

## HomePage Changes
- Refactored `HomePage.tsx` to implement chat state management
- Added messages array state to track conversation history
- Updated API call logic to add messages to the chat history
- Positioned the chat window flush against bottom-left with minimal padding according to HUD requirements
- Made the chat window more compact with smaller font sizes
- Used Shadcn's ScrollArea component for better scrolling experience
- Maintained the main content area with the OpenAgents Commander title

## Next Steps
- Implement the hotbar component at the bottom center
- Implement the inspector window at the bottom right
- Add Bitcoin balance display at the top right
- Consider adding a resize handle for the chat window
- Implement message persistence across sessions
