# React Three Fiber (R3F) Setup Log

## Overview
This log documents the implementation of React Three Fiber (R3F) as a background canvas for the HomePage component.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Created R3F Component Directory
- Created `src/components/r3f/` directory for organizing R3F components

### 2. Created BackgroundScene Component
- Created `src/components/r3f/BackgroundScene.tsx` with a simple rotating cube scene
- Implemented proper lighting with ambient and directional lights
- Used Tailwind primary color variable in the material for consistent theming

### 3. Integrated R3F Canvas in HomePage
- Modified `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` to:
  - Import R3F Canvas and BackgroundScene components
  - Add a fixed-position full-screen container for the canvas
  - Set z-index to -1 to ensure the canvas stays behind all other UI elements
  - Set z-index to 10 for chat window to ensure it stays on top

### 4. ESLint Configuration
- Added `.eslintrc.json` in the R3F directory to suppress warnings about JSX props used by R3F
- Configured exceptions for position, args, intensity, roughness, and metalness props

### 5. Verification
- Ran TypeScript check using `pnpm run t` to ensure type safety
- TypeScript check passed with no errors

## Implementation Details

### BackgroundScene Component
The BackgroundScene component includes:
- A rotating cube with primary theme color
- Ambient light for base illumination
- Directional light for more realistic lighting and shadows
- Proper positioning to ensure visibility without overwhelming the UI

### HomePage Integration
- Canvas is positioned as a fixed background that covers the entire viewport
- Z-index management ensures proper layering:
  - Canvas at z-index -1 (background)
  - Chat window at z-index 10 (foreground)
- Existing HomePage layout remains unchanged, maintaining all functionality

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding more complex 3D elements or animations
- Implement responsive behavior for the 3D scene
- Add user interaction with the 3D elements
- Explore performance optimizations for lower-end devices
