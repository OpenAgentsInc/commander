# MediaPipe Hand Tracking Implementation Log

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented a MediaPipe hand tracking demo that overlays hand landmarks on top of the physics balls scene. The implementation includes a toggle switch to enable/disable hand tracking visualization while keeping the webcam hidden.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Structure Changes

- Modified `/src/components/r3f/InteractiveHandScene.tsx` to be a minimal empty component
- Modified `/src/pages/HandTrackingDemoPage.tsx` to incorporate the physics balls scene and hand tracking
- Used the existing route in `/src/routes/routes.tsx` for the demo page

### 2. Components and Pages

#### InteractiveHandScene.tsx
- Simplified to return null (empty scene)
- Retained type interface for backward compatibility
- Removed all 3D sphere-related code

#### HandTrackingDemoPage.tsx
- Added the PhysicsBallsScene as the background
- Added a toggle switch to enable/disable hand tracking
- Fixed hand orientation by adjusting the isRightHand logic
- Enhanced hand landmark visualization with larger, more visible points
- Made webcam video invisible (opacity: 0) while keeping it functional for tracking
- Implemented clear error handling for MediaPipe WebAssembly

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- Implemented the global `moduleInitialized` flag to prevent WebAssembly module reinitialization
- Added try/catch blocks around MediaPipe operations
- Silently catches and logs frame processing errors to prevent app crashes
- Added conditional rendering based on the toggle switch state

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- Used model complexity 0 (lite) for faster processing
- Set appropriate detection and tracking confidence thresholds
- Set `selfieMode: false` to correct hand orientation

### 5. UI Improvements

- Added a toggle switch using Shadcn UI components
- Placed status and controls in a semi-transparent overlay
- Hid the webcam video element while keeping it functional
- Made hand landmarks more visible with increased line width and point size

## WebAssembly Error Resolution

The primary issue was caused by the WebAssembly module's initialization and resource management in Electron.

Key fixes:
1. Removed the 3D sphere entirely, which eliminates WebGL context conflicts
2. Set a global flag to prevent MediaPipe from reinitializing its WebAssembly module
3. Simplified the hand tracking visualization to avoid problematic interactions

## Usage

To use the hand tracking demo:
1. Navigate to the demo page via the "Hand Tracking Demo" button on the home page
2. Allow camera access when prompted
3. The PhysicsBallsScene will be shown in the background
4. Hand tracking is enabled by default - green outlines for right hand, red for left hand
5. Use the toggle switch in the top-left corner to enable/disable hand tracking
6. The status message shows detection information when hand tracking is enabled

This implementation successfully combines the physics ball simulation with optional hand tracking visualization, while hiding the webcam feed for a cleaner interface.
