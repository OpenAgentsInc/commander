# MediaPipe Hand Tracking Implementation Log

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented a MediaPipe hand tracking feature that's directly integrated into the home page, using a toggle switch to enable/disable hand tracking visualization while keeping the webcam hidden. The implementation includes interactive physics control, allowing users to manipulate the 3D cubes with hand gestures.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Structure Changes

- Modified `/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` to include hand tracking functionality with a toggle switch
- Removed separate `/src/pages/HandTrackingDemoPage.tsx` route and component
- Updated `/src/routes/routes.tsx` to remove the dedicated hand tracking route
- Simplified the R3F scene in HomePage to avoid conflicts with MediaPipe
- Added new interactive components for hand and mouse control

### 2. Components and Pages

#### HomePage.tsx

- Added hand tracking capabilities with a toggle switch in the top right corner
- Integrated webcam access and MediaPipe Hands tracking directly in the home page
- Made webcam video invisible while keeping it functional for tracking
- Enhanced hand landmark visualization with larger points and thicker lines
- Fixed hand orientation by adjusting the isRightHand logic
- Simplified the 3D scene to avoid conflicts with EffectComposer
- Added interactive physics control with hand tracking
- Implemented fallback to mouse control when hand tracking is disabled

### 3. New Interactive Features

- **Hand-based Physics Interaction**: Right index finger position is tracked and used to move a physics collider
- **Dynamic 3D Cube Manipulation**: Users can push, move, and interact with 3D cubes using hand movements
- **Seamless Mouse/Hand Switching**: Automatically switches between mouse and hand control based on hand tracking state
- **Invisible Interaction Collider**: Uses an invisible collider that follows the user's hand position
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Maps normalized hand coordinates (0-1) to 3D viewport space

### 4. Error Handling Improvements

- Added conditional initialization and cleanup of MediaPipe based on toggle state
- Implemented the global `moduleInitialized` flag to prevent WebAssembly module reinitialization
- Added try/catch blocks around MediaPipe operations
- Silently catches and logs frame processing errors to prevent app crashes
- Fixed TypeScript type issues for better code safety
- Made components safer with better error boundaries

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Used model complexity 0 (lite) for faster processing
- Set appropriate detection and tracking confidence thresholds
- Set `selfieMode: false` to correct hand orientation
- Simplified the 3D scene by removing the EffectComposer that was causing conflicts
- Used `frameloop="demand"` to only render frames when needed

### 6. UI Improvements

- Added a toggle switch using Shadcn UI components in the top-right corner
- Status message showing hand detection appears only when hand tracking is enabled
- Hand tracking is disabled by default to conserve resources
- Hid the webcam video element while keeping it functional for tracking
- Made hand landmarks more visible with increased line width and point size

## WebAssembly Error Resolution

The primary issue was caused by the WebAssembly module's initialization and resource management in Electron.

Key fixes:

1. Removed the EffectComposer from the scene, which was causing conflicts
2. Simplified the 3D scene to avoid WebGL context sharing issues
3. Set a global flag to prevent MediaPipe from reinitializing its WebAssembly module
4. Added proper cleanup when hand tracking is disabled

## Usage

To use the hand tracking feature:

1. Navigate to the home page of the app
2. Click the "Hand Tracking" toggle switch in the top-right corner to enable it
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Hand tracking will display on top of the 3D physics balls scene
5. Green outlines indicate the right hand, red outlines indicate the left hand
6. Move your right index finger to interact with and push the 3D cubes
7. When hand tracking is disabled, mouse interaction takes over automatically
8. A status message appears showing detection information when hand tracking is enabled
9. Toggle off the hand tracking when not in use to save resources

The implementation successfully integrates interactive hand tracking directly into the home page, allowing users to physically manipulate 3D objects with natural hand movements while maintaining the aesthetics of the original scene.
