# Refactoring to Pane-Based System Log

## Overview

This log documents the refactoring process from a multi-page routing system to a single HUD with a pane-based system. The goal is to keep all interactions within one main view, managing different "pages" or "views" as panes.

## Initial Analysis

I'll be working from the instructions to refactor the application from using TanStack Router for multiple pages to a single pane-based HUD. This means converting various pages (wallet setup, seed phrase backup, restore, etc.) into panes within the main application window.

## Phase 1: Prepare Pane System

First, I'll update the pane types and add necessary constants for the new page panes.

### Updating `src/types/pane.ts`

Added the following new pane types to the `Pane['type']` union:

- `'second_page_content'`
- `'wallet_setup_content'`
- `'seed_phrase_backup_content'`
- `'restore_wallet_content'`

Also added new content fields to the `Pane['content']` object:

- `seedPhrase?: string;` - For passing seed phrase data to the backup pane
- `data?: Record<string, any>;` - Generic data bucket for future extensibility

### Updating `src/stores/panes/constants.ts`

Added new constants for the page panes:

- `SECOND_PAGE_PANE_ID` and `SECOND_PAGE_PANE_TITLE`
- `WALLET_SETUP_PANE_ID` and `WALLET_SETUP_PANE_TITLE`
- `SEED_PHRASE_BACKUP_PANE_ID` and `SEED_PHRASE_BACKUP_PANE_TITLE`
- `RESTORE_WALLET_PANE_ID` and `RESTORE_WALLET_PANE_TITLE`

### Creating Pane Actions

I've created new action files for opening each page as a pane.

1. **`openSecondPagePane.ts`**: Created an action to open the SecondPage component in a pane.
2. **`openWalletSetupPane.ts`**: Created an action to open the WalletSetupPage component in a pane. Made it non-dismissable since it's part of a critical setup flow.
3. **`openSeedPhraseBackupPane.ts`**: Created an action to open the SeedPhraseBackupPage component with a seedPhrase passed via content. Also non-dismissable.
4. **`openRestoreWalletPane.ts`**: Created an action to open the RestoreWalletPage component in a pane.

### Updating Pane Actions Index

Added exports for all the new pane actions to `src/stores/panes/actions/index.ts`.

### Updating Pane Store Types

Updated `src/stores/panes/types.ts` to include the new action signatures:

- `openSecondPagePane: () => void`
- `openWalletSetupPane: () => void`
- `openSeedPhraseBackupPane: (params: OpenSeedPhraseBackupPaneParams) => void`
- `openRestoreWalletPane: () => void`

### Updating Pane Store

Updated `src/stores/pane.ts` to:

1. Import the new action functions from the actions module
2. Add implementations for each new action in the usePaneStore object

### Updating PaneManager

Updated `src/panes/PaneManager.tsx` to:

1. Import the page components from their respective files
2. Add rendering logic to display these components when their corresponding pane types are present
3. Pass required props to the components:
   - `paneId` to `WalletSetupPage`, `SeedPhraseBackupPage`, and `RestoreWalletPage`
   - `seedPhrase` from `pane.content.seedPhrase` to `SeedPhraseBackupPage`
4. Update the fallback condition to include the new pane types

This completes Phase 1 of preparing the pane system to handle the existing page content.

## Phase 2: Refactor Router and Application Entry Logic

### Simplifying `src/routes/routes.tsx`

- Removed all route definitions except for `HomeRoute` (path: "/")
- Updated the `rootTree` to only contain `HomeRoute`
- Added a comment explaining the refactoring approach

### Updating `src/routes/__root.tsx`

- Removed the wallet initialization check using `useEffect`
- Simplified imports (removed `useRouter` and `useWalletStore`)
- Kept the core functionality of rendering `BaseLayout` with `Outlet`

### Implementing Initial Pane Logic in `src/App.tsx`

- Added imports for `useWalletStore`, `usePaneStore`, and pane ID constants
- Added a new `useEffect` that runs once on component mount
- Logic in the effect:
  1. Gets the current wallet initialization state with `useWalletStore.getState().isInitialized`
  2. Gets the current panes with `usePaneStore.getState().panes`
  3. If wallet is not initialized, checks if a setup-related pane is already open
  4. If no setup pane is open, calls `usePaneStore.getState().openWalletSetupPane()`

This completes Phase 2. Now any navigation should happen through pane actions rather than route changes, and the app will automatically show the wallet setup pane if the wallet is not initialized.

## Phase 3: Adapt Wallet Setup Flow to Use Panes

### Updating `src/pages/WalletSetupPage.tsx`

- Modified component to accept `paneId` as a prop
- Removed `useNavigate` hook
- Added `usePaneStore` hook to access pane actions
- Changed `handleCreateNewWallet` to:
  - Call `useWalletStore.generateNewWallet()`
  - Use `openSeedPhraseBackupPane({ seedPhrase: newSeedPhrase })` instead of router navigation
  - Call `removePane(paneId)` to close itself
- Changed `handleRestoreWallet` to:
  - Call `openRestoreWalletPane()`
  - Call `removePane(paneId)` to close itself
- Updated container height from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-full` for pane context

### Updating `src/pages/SeedPhraseBackupPage.tsx`

- Modified component to accept `seedPhrase` and `paneId` as props
- Removed `useNavigate`, `useSearch`, and `useEffect` for URL param logic
- Added `usePaneStore` hook to access the `removePane` action
- Changed `handleContinue` to:
  - Call `_initializeWalletWithSeed()` as before
  - Call `removePane(paneId)` to close itself
  - Show `SelfCustodyNoticeDialog` if needed, without navigating
- Updated container height from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-full` for pane context

### Updating `src/pages/RestoreWalletPage.tsx`

- Modified component to accept `paneId` as a prop
- Removed `useNavigate` hook
- Added `usePaneStore` hook to access `removePane` and `openWalletSetupPane` actions
- Changed `handleRestore` to:
  - Call `restoreWallet()` as before
  - Call `removePane(paneId)` to close itself
  - Show `SelfCustodyNoticeDialog` if needed, without navigating
- Changed "Back to Setup" button to use pane actions instead of router navigation
- Updated container height from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-full` for pane context

### Updating `src/components/wallet/SelfCustodyNoticeDialog.tsx`

- Removed `useNavigate` hook
- Simplified `handleConfirm` to:
  - Call `setHasSeenSelfCustodyNotice()`
  - Call `onOpenChange(false)` to close the dialog
  - Removed navigation to '/' as it's no longer needed

This completes Phase 3. The wallet setup flow now operates entirely within the pane system rather than using router navigation.

## Phase 4: Update Navigation Elements

### Updating `src/components/template/NavigationMenu.tsx`

- Removed `Link` import from TanStack Router
- Added `usePaneStore` hook and imported `Button` component
- Replaced the Home page link with a Button that logs to console (can be enhanced later)
- Replaced the Second Page link with a Button that calls `openSecondPagePane()`

This completes the refactoring of the application from a multi-page router system to a single HUD with panes. The application now:

1. Renders `HomePage` as the main view through the simplified router
2. Uses panes to display content that was previously rendered as separate pages
3. Uses pane actions instead of router navigation for user interactions
4. Determines whether to show wallet setup based on wallet initialization state
5. Maintains a consistent HUD view throughout the application

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests

The following unit tests will need to be updated to account for the refactoring:

- Any tests for wallet-related pages that mock `useNavigate`
- Tests that check URL navigation as part of the wallet setup flow
- Tests for components that previously used router links

The approach for updating these tests would be:

1. Replace `useNavigate` mocks with `usePaneStore` mocks
2. Verify that appropriate pane actions are called instead of navigation
3. Update component props to include `paneId` where required
4. Update tests for `App.tsx` to verify it opens the wallet setup pane when appropriate

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests that relied on URL-based navigation will need significant updates:

1. Replace URL assertions with checks for pane existence or visibility
2. Update interaction patterns to work with panes rather than page navigation
3. Verify pane opening/closing behavior works correctly

### Manual Testing

Areas to focus on during manual testing:

1. Wallet initialization flow
2. Navigation between panes
3. Dialog interactions
4. Pane dismissal behavior
5. Second page access through NavigationMenu
