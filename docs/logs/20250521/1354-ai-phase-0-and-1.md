# Implementation Log: Effect AI Integration - Phase 0 & 1

## Overview
This log tracks the implementation of Phase 0 (Foundation and Setup) and Phase 1 (Core AI Service Abstractions) of the Commander AI Roadmap. These phases establish the groundwork for transitioning OpenAgents Commander to a new, robust, and provider-agnostic AI backend leveraging the Effect ecosystem.

## Goals
- Implement Phase 0: Set up dependencies and project structure
- Implement Phase 1: Define core AI service abstractions and interfaces

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Foundation and Setup
- [x] Add core AI dependencies to package.json
- [x] Verify existing platform dependencies
- [x] Create base AI services directory structure

### Phase 1: Core AI Service Abstractions
- [x] Define AgentLanguageModel service
- [x] Define AgentChatSession service
- [ ] Define AgentToolkitManager service
- [x] Define AgentChatMessage schema
- [ ] Define Provider Configuration schemas
- [ ] Define custom AI error types
- [ ] Create core AI services index.ts

## Progress Log

### May 21, 2025 - 13:54
- Started implementation of Phase 0 and 1
- Created this log file
- Read through relevant documentation:
  - AI-ROADMAP.md
  - AI-PHASE01.md
  - effect/ai/01-introduction.md
  - effect/ai/02-getting-started.md

### May 21, 2025 - 14:00
- Added required dependencies to package.json:
  - @effect/ai (^0.2.0)
  - @effect/ai-openai (^0.2.0)
  - @effect/ai-anthropic (^0.2.0)
- Ran `pnpm install` to install new dependencies
- Verified existing platform dependencies:
  - @effect/platform (^0.82.2)
  - @effect/platform-browser (^0.62.3)
  - @effect/platform-node (^0.80.3) - in devDependencies

Note: There were some peer dependency warnings which might need to be addressed in the future, but the installation was successful.

### May 21, 2025 - 14:05

### May 21, 2025 - 14:20
- Implemented AgentChatSession service interface:
  - Defined methods for conversation history management (add, get, clear)
  - Added methods for preparing messages for AI models
  - Included token counting and context window handling
  - Created Context.GenericTag for dependency injection
