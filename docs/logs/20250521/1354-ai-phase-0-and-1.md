# Implementation Log: Effect AI Integration - Phase 0 & 1

## Overview
This log tracks the implementation of Phase 0 (Foundation and Setup) and Phase 1 (Core AI Service Abstractions) of the Commander AI Roadmap. These phases establish the groundwork for transitioning OpenAgents Commander to a new, robust, and provider-agnostic AI backend leveraging the Effect ecosystem.

## Goals
- Implement Phase 0: Set up dependencies and project structure
- Implement Phase 1: Define core AI service abstractions and interfaces

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Foundation and Setup
- [x] Add core AI dependencies to package.json
- [x] Verify existing platform dependencies
- [x] Create base AI services directory structure

### Phase 1: Core AI Service Abstractions
- [x] Define AgentLanguageModel service
- [x] Define AgentChatSession service
- [x] Define AgentToolkitManager service
- [x] Define AgentChatMessage schema
- [x] Define Provider Configuration schemas
- [x] Define custom AI error types
- [x] Create core AI services index.ts

## Progress Log

### May 21, 2025 - 13:54
- Started implementation of Phase 0 and 1
- Created this log file
- Read through relevant documentation:
  - AI-ROADMAP.md
  - AI-PHASE01.md
  - effect/ai/01-introduction.md
  - effect/ai/02-getting-started.md

### May 21, 2025 - 14:00
- Added required dependencies to package.json:
  - @effect/ai (^0.2.0)
  - @effect/ai-openai (^0.2.0)
  - @effect/ai-anthropic (^0.2.0)
- Ran `pnpm install` to install new dependencies
- Verified existing platform dependencies:
  - @effect/platform (^0.82.2)
  - @effect/platform-browser (^0.62.3)
  - @effect/platform-node (^0.80.3) - in devDependencies

Note: There were some peer dependency warnings which might need to be addressed in the future, but the installation was successful.

### May 21, 2025 - 14:05
- Created base AI services directory structure:
  - src/services/ai/
  - src/services/ai/core/
- Created initial index.ts files for re-exporting modules

### May 21, 2025 - 14:10
- Implemented AgentLanguageModel service interface:
  - Defined the core interface mirroring @effect/ai's AiLanguageModel
  - Added methods: generateText, streamText, generateStructured
  - Created Context.GenericTag for dependency injection
  - Re-exported AiLanguageModel types from @effect/ai

### May 21, 2025 - 14:15
- Implemented AgentChatMessage schema:
  - Defined schemas using @effect/schema for type validation
  - Created schemas for chat messages and tool calls
  - Added helper functions for creating various message types (user, assistant, system, tool)
  - Added UI-specific fields for streaming and timestamps

### May 21, 2025 - 14:20
- Implemented AgentChatSession service interface:
  - Defined methods for conversation history management (add, get, clear)
  - Added methods for preparing messages for AI models
  - Included token counting and context window handling
  - Created Context.GenericTag for dependency injection

### May 21, 2025 - 14:25
- Implemented AgentToolkitManager service interface:
  - Defined methods for tool management (register, get toolkit)
  - Added method for executing tools with given arguments
  - Created Context.GenericTag for dependency injection
  - Re-exported AiToolkit and AiTool types from @effect/ai

### May 21, 2025 - 14:30
- Implemented Provider Configuration schemas:
  - Created base provider configuration schema with common fields
  - Added specialized schemas for different provider types (API key, URL-based)
  - Created provider-specific schemas for OpenAI, Ollama, and Anthropic
  - Added discriminated union schema for typed configurations
  - Used Schema from Effect for type validation and derivation

### May 21, 2025 - 14:35
- Implemented custom AI error types:
  - Created AIGenericError as the base class using Data.TaggedError
  - Added specialized error types for different failure scenarios
  - Created AIProviderError for API/provider-specific issues
  - Added AIConfigurationError for setup problems
  - Implemented AIToolExecutionError for tool use failures
  - Created AIContextWindowError for token limit issues
  - Added helper function to convert generic errors to Provider errors

### May 21, 2025 - 14:40
- Organized core AI services index.ts:
  - Added comprehensive documentation for the module
  - Categorized exports by type (services, data structures, errors)
  - Ensured all core abstractions are properly exported
  - Completed implementation of Phase 0 and Phase 1

### May 21, 2025 - 14:50
- Fixed TypeScript errors:
  - Fixed import paths to match actual @effect/ai package structure
  - Corrected ToolKit types in AgentToolkitManager
  - Fixed AIError class definitions with proper tag handling 
  - Successfully passed TypeScript type checking
  - Ensured complete compatibility with Effect's type system
