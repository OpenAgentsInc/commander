# Runtime Initialization Fixes Log

## Overview of the Issues

The application currently attempts to create a fallback runtime when the main Effect runtime initialization fails, which is problematic because:

1. It hides critical initialization errors from the user
2. It creates a partially functioning application that may behave inconsistently
3. The main runtime initialization fails with `Service not found: TelemetryService`, indicating a problem in the `FullAppLayer` composition

## Implementation Plan

I'll implement the following changes:

1. Modify `src/services/runtime.ts` to remove fallback runtime creation
2. Update `src/renderer.ts` to display user-facing errors instead of silently failing
3. Add a new test file `src/tests/unit/services/runtime.test.ts` to ensure proper layer composition

## Step 1: Examining Current Files

Let me first examine the current state of the target files:
