Okay, Agent! Let's focus on getting some "easy wins" by tackling a few specific categories of TypeScript errors from your list. These fixes should be relatively straightforward and help clean up a good portion of the reported issues.

We will focus on these three areas:

1.  **Fixing `AiResponse` Mock Errors in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`**: This involves ensuring your mock objects for `AiResponse` are complete.
2.  **Fixing `HttpClientResponse.empty` Deprecation in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`**: This is a direct method replacement.
3.  **Fixing `message` Property in `HttpClientError.ResponseError` in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`**: This is a property name change in a constructor.

Here are the specific instructions:

**Instruction Set 1: Fixing `AiResponse` Mock Errors in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`**

*   **File to Modify:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
*   **Errors Addressed:** TS2352 (related to missing `[TypeId]`, `role`, `parts`, and methods like `withToolCallsJson` on `AiResponse` mocks). This corresponds to errors on lines like 28, 36, 45, 54, 71, 80, 89, 98 from your original error list.
*   **Problem:** The objects you're creating and casting `as AiResponse` are structurally incomplete. The `AiResponse` type from `@effect/ai` (or your custom definition if it's different but aims for compatibility) includes specific properties and methods, often due to extending Effect's `Data.Case` or similar patterns (`Equal.Equal`, `Hash.Hash`).

*   **Instructions:**
    For each place in `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` where you have an object literal being cast `as AiResponse` (typically inside `Effect.succeed` or `Effect.map` within the mock `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` implementation):

    1.  **Ensure Required Properties are Present:**
        *   Add `role: "assistant"` (or an appropriate role string, e.g., "tool" if mocking a tool response).
        *   Add `parts: [{ _tag: "text", content: "YOUR_MOCK_TEXT_HERE" } as const]`. (The `AiMessagePart` type typically has a `_tag`. If `content` is the main field, adjust `parts` or `text` property as per the actual `AiResponse` interface).
        *   If your `AiResponse` definition has `text: string` directly, ensure that's present. If it uses `parts`, then `text` might be a getter or not directly on the interface. Prioritize matching the actual interface from `@effect/ai/AiResponse`.
        *   Remove fields like `imageUrl`, `content: []` (top-level), and `structured: {}` if they are not part of the actual `AiResponse` interface. These should typically be within the `parts` array if they represent different content types.
    2.  **Add Method Stubs:**
        The `AiResponse` interface includes methods. You must provide stubs for them. The stubs themselves should return a minimally valid `AiResponse` mock to satisfy type checking.
        *   `withToolCallsJson: () => { /* minimal AiResponse structure + symbols */ } as unknown as AiResponse,`
        *   `withToolCallsUnknown: () => { /* minimal AiResponse structure + symbols */ } as unknown as AiResponse,`
        *   `concat: (_other: AiResponse) => { /* minimal AiResponse structure + symbols */ } as unknown as AiResponse,`
    3.  **Add Effect Data Symbols:**
        These are required if `AiResponse` extends `Equal.Equal` and `Hash.Hash` from `effect/Data` or `effect/Equal`.
        *   `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,`
        *   `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,`
    4.  **Final Cast:** After adding these, if TypeScript still complains (especially about `[TypeId]`), use the suggested cast: `} as unknown as AiResponse)`.

    **Example for the `generateText` mock in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` (apply similarly to `generateStructured` and the stubs within stubs):**

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts
    // Inside the mock OpenAiLanguageModel.model:

    generateText: (params: any): Effect.Effect<AiResponse, unknown> =>
      Effect.succeed({
        // Assuming AiResponse has 'text' and 'usage' directly
        text: "Not implemented in mock",
        usage: { total_tokens: 0 },
        // Required by AiResponse interface (example structure)
        role: "assistant",
        parts: [{ _tag: "text", content: "Not implemented in mock" } as const],
        // Method stubs - these MUST return a valid AiResponse-like object
        withToolCallsJson: () => ({
          text: "stub", usage: { total_tokens: 0 }, role: "assistant", parts: [],
          withToolCallsJson: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse), // Recursive stub
          withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse), // Recursive stub
          concat: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse), // Recursive stub
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
        } as unknown as AiResponse),
        withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({
          text: "stub", usage: { total_tokens: 0 }, role: "assistant", parts: [],
          withToolCallsJson: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          concat: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
        } as unknown as AiResponse),
        concat: (_other: AiResponse) => ({
          text: "stub", usage: { total_tokens: 0 }, role: "assistant", parts: [],
          withToolCallsJson: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          concat: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
        } as unknown as AiResponse),
        // Effect Data symbols
        [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
        [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
      } as unknown as AiResponse),
    ```

    **Verification:**
    *   Open `node_modules/@effect/ai/dist/dts/AiResponse.d.ts` (the path might vary slightly depending on your pnpm/node_modules structure) to see the exact interface of `AiResponse`.
    *   Ensure your mocks include all non-optional properties and methods.

**Instruction Set 2: Fixing `HttpClientResponse.empty` Deprecation in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`**

*   **File to Modify:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`
*   **Errors Addressed:** TS2339 (Lines 171, 186, 201, 277, 321, 349, 379 from your original error list) - `Property 'empty' does not exist...` (The log mentioned `.make` was tried but still errored, implying the previous fix wasn't quite right or the error message evolved. Let's ensure the correct method is used according to `@effect/platform` v0.82.2).
*   **Problem:** `HttpClientResponse.empty` is deprecated or removed. The correct way to create an `HttpClientResponse.HttpClientResponse` is often `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb()` or `HttpClientResponse.json()`, or directly constructing an object if needed for errors. For creating a response to pass into `HttpClientError.ResponseError`, you'll likely need to construct a minimal `Response` object.

*   **Instructions:**
    For all lines where `HttpClientResponse.empty({ status: CODE })` or `HttpClientResponse.make({ status: CODE })` was used to create the `response` field for an `HttpClientError.ResponseError`:

    1.  Create a standard Web API `Response` object first.
    2.  Use `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(request, webResponse)` to create the `HttpClientResponse.HttpClientResponse`.

    **Example for line 171 (and apply similarly to others like 186, 201, 277, 321, 349, 379):**

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts
    // Inside a catch block or error path where you construct HttpClientError.ResponseError

    // Assuming 'request' is an HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest instance already defined
    // For example:
    // const request = HttpClientRequest.get("ollama-ipc-nonstream"); // Or whatever the original request was

    // Create a Web API Response for the error status
    const webErrorResponse = new Response(
        JSON.stringify({ error: "Error from Ollama IPC" }), // Optional error body
        {
          status: 500, // Or 501 for "Not Implemented"
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
        }
    );

    // Create the HttpClientResponse using fromWeb
    const httpClientErrorResponse = HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(request, webErrorResponse);

    return new HttpClientError.ResponseError({
        request: request,
        response: httpClientErrorResponse, // USE THIS
        reason: "StatusCode", // Or other valid HttpClientErrorReason
        cause: providerError, // The original AIProviderError
        description: String(providerError.message),
    });
    ```
    **Note:** Ensure `request` (the first argument to `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb`) is a valid `HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest` object relevant to the operation that failed. If you don't have the original request object easily available in the error handler, you might need to create a placeholder: `const placeholderRequest = HttpClientRequest.get("error-path");`.

**Instruction Set 3: Fixing `message` Property in `HttpClientError.ResponseError` Constructor in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`**

*   **File to Modify:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`
*   **Errors Addressed:** TS2353 (Lines 174, 192, 207, 280, 324, 352, 385 from your original error list) - `'message' does not exist... did you mean 'description'`.
*   **Problem:** The constructor for `HttpClientError.ResponseError` expects the textual error message in a field named `description`, not `message`.
*   **Instructions:**
    For all indicated lines where you construct `new HttpClientError.ResponseError(...)`:
    1.  Rename the `message:` property to `description:`.
    2.  Ensure the value assigned to `description:` is a string.

    **Example for line 174 (and apply similarly to others):**

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts
    //...
    return new HttpClientError.ResponseError({
        request: request, // Assume 'request' is defined
        response: httpClientErrorResponse, // Assume 'httpClientErrorResponse' is defined as per Instruction Set 2
        reason: "StatusCode",
        cause: providerError,
        // message: providerError.message, // OLD
        description: String(providerError.message), // NEW - ensure it's a string
    });
    //...
    ```
    If `providerError` might not be an `Error` instance, use `(providerError instanceof Error ? providerError.message : String(providerError))` to safely get a string message.

After applying these changes, run `pnpm t` again. These fixes should address the targeted errors. Report back with the new error list if any remain, and we'll tackle the next set.
