# Fix for AgentLanguageModel Service Not Found Error

## Issue
Application was failing to start with error: `Error: Service not found: AgentLanguageModel (defined at http://localhost:5173/src/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel.ts:2:43)`

After fixing that, it crashed with: `Error: Could not find AiLanguageModel tag in OpenAiCompletions`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The issue was in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`. Our simplified provider approach with manual construction of a mock provider object doesn't properly integrate with Effect's runtime context system. This causes the `AgentLanguageModel` tag not to be correctly registered in the application's Effect context.

2. The second error occurred because we were trying to access a non-existent tag `AiLanguageModel` in OpenAiCompletions. After examining the actual code in the Effect.js libraries, I found that the correct tag to use is `Completions` from `@effect/ai/Completions`.

## Implementation

I examined the Effect AI documentation and the actual source code in the `node_modules/@effect/ai-openai` directory to understand the correct pattern for creating a Layer with the OpenAI integration.

The key findings:

1. `OpenAiCompletions.layerCompletions()` creates a Layer that provides a `Completions` service, not a direct AiLanguageModel service
2. We need to first add this Layer to our runtime context and then get the `Completions` service
3. Then we need to adapt the `Completions` service methods to our `AgentLanguageModel` interface

### Solution:

1. Use `OpenAiCompletions.layerCompletions({ model: modelName })` to create the Layer
2. Provide the `ollamaAdaptedClient` to this Layer using `Layer.provide()`
3. Add this combined Layer to our current context with `Effect.provideLayer()`
4. Get the `Completions` service using `yield* _(Completions)`
5. Create an adapter implementation of `AgentLanguageModel` that calls the `Completions` service

The key difference from previous attempts is that we're properly following the Effect.js pattern by:
1. Creating a Layer with the proper OpenAiCompletions.layerCompletions() function
2. Correctly adding it to our runtime context
3. Using the standard Effect.js service access pattern to get the Completions service
4. Using the actual Completions API methods (create, stream) to implement our AgentLanguageModel interface

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// Create the OpenAI completions layer with our model configuration
const completionsLayer = OpenAiCompletions.layerCompletions({
  model: modelName
});

// Provide the Ollama adapter client to the completions layer
const completionsWithClientLayer = Layer.provide(
  Layer.succeed(OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, ollamaAdaptedClient),
  completionsLayer
);

// Add this layer to our current context
yield* _(Effect.provideLayer(Effect.succeed(undefined), completionsWithClientLayer));

// Get the Completions service from our context
const completionsService = yield* _(Completions);
```

This correctly sets up the Effect.js Layer and service system and ensures the `AgentLanguageModel` service is properly registered and available in the application's runtime context.
