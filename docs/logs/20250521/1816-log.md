# Implementation Log for TypeScript Fixes (1816)

This log tracks the implementation of TypeScript fixes as described in `1816-instructions.md`.

## 1. Fixing `AiResponse` Mock Errors

**File:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`

### Changes:
- Updated the `generateStructured` method's AiResponse mock to fully satisfy the interface requirements
- Added proper method stubs for `withToolCallsJson`, `withToolCallsUnknown`, and `concat` that return valid AiResponse objects
- Added `as const` to the parts array items to ensure proper type inference
- Changed the final cast from `as AiResponse` to `as unknown as AiResponse` to address TypeScript errors
- Ensured all method stubs include the required Effect Data symbols for equality and hashing

The mock structure now properly includes all required properties and methods with the correct signatures, which should resolve the TypeScript errors related to incomplete mock objects.

## 2. Fixing HttpClientResponse Usage in OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts

**File:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`

### Problem:
The `HttpClientResponse.make()` method no longer exists in the current version of `@effect/platform`. TypeScript was reporting errors like:
```
Property 'make' does not exist on type 'typeof import("@effect/platform/HttpClientResponse")'
```

### Changes:
- Replaced all instances of `HttpClientResponse.make({ status: ... })` with `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(request, webResponse)`
- Used standard Web API `Response` constructor to create the response object: `new Response("", { status: ... })`
- Wrapped the error creation in IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for clean implementation
- Used the same request object for both the `request` parameter and the `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb` call

Example of the updated pattern:
```typescript
(() => {
  const request = HttpClientRequest.get("ollama-ipc-nonstream");
  const webResponse = new Response("", { status: 500 });
  return new HttpClientError.ResponseError({
    request,
    response: HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(request, webResponse),
    reason: "StatusCode",
    cause: providerError,
    description: String(providerError.message),
  });
})()
```

This update ensures compatibility with the current version of `@effect/platform` which requires using `fromWeb` with a standard Web API `Response` object.

## 3. Fixing Test File Issues in OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts

**File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts`

### Changes:
- Fixed test assertions for `client.chat` (Lines 57-66 and 144-152)
  - Changed variable name from `client` to `resolvedClient` to better indicate its resolved nature
  - Updated all test assertions to use `resolvedClient.client.chat.completions.create` instead of directly accessing the client
- Re-enabled skipped tests by removing the `.skip` from the test declarations

These changes ensure the test assertions correctly match the structure of the `OpenAiClient.Service` interface, which has:
```typescript
{
  client: GeneratedClient, // GeneratedClient has chat.completions.create
  stream: (params) => Stream,
  streamRequest: (params) => Stream
}
```

The tests now access the non-streaming methods via `resolvedClient.client.chat.completions.create`, which matches the actual service structure.

## 4. Fixing HttpClient Tag in OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

**File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`

### Problem:
The test was using `HttpClient.HttpClient` as the tag, but we found that HttpClient itself is the tag. TypeScript was reporting:
```
Property 'Tag' does not exist on type 'Tag<HttpClient, HttpClient>'
```

### Changes:
- Changed `Layer.succeed(HttpClient.HttpClient, mockHttpClient)` to `Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClient)`
- Re-enabled all skipped tests by removing the `.skip` from the test declarations:
  - "should successfully build the layer and provide AgentLanguageModel"
  - "should use default model name if config value is not found"
  - "should properly call generateText with correct parameters" 
  - "should properly map errors from the client to AIProviderError"

This ensures the tests use the correct tag for the HttpClient service. In @effect/platform, HttpClient is already the tag itself (`Context.Tag<HttpClient, HttpClient>`), so no further qualification is needed.
