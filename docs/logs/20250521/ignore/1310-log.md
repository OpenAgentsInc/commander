# Implementation Log: Fixing Infinite Loop in WalletSetupPage

## Task Overview

The task is to fix an infinite loop issue in the WalletSetupPage component that's causing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error. The issue is related to how the component is using Zustand store hooks.

## Investigation

I examined the WalletSetupPage.tsx file and identified the problematic Zustand store hook usage. The component is creating a new object on every render when selecting from the store, which is triggering infinite re-renders.

The key issue is at line 13 where the component is using `useWalletStore` with a selector function that returns a new object reference on each call:

```typescript
const { generateNewWallet, isLoading, error, clearError } = useWalletStore(
  (state) => ({
    generateNewWallet: state.generateNewWallet,
    isLoading: state.isLoading,
    error: state.error,
    clearError: state.clearError,
  }),
);
```

Similar issues exist in other components that use Zustand with object selectors.

## Initial Solution Attempt

I first tried applying shallow equality checking to all components:

1. **Added shallow equality checking to WalletSetupPage.tsx**:
   - Added the `shallow` import from 'zustand/shallow'
   - Applied shallow equality check to both `useWalletStore` and `usePaneStore` hooks

```typescript
import { shallow } from "zustand/shallow";

// ...

const { generateNewWallet, isLoading, error, clearError } = useWalletStore(
  (state) => ({
    generateNewWallet: state.generateNewWallet,
    isLoading: state.isLoading,
    error: state.error,
    clearError: state.clearError,
  }),
  shallow, // Add shallow equality check to prevent unnecessary re-renders
);
```

2. **Applied the same fix to related components**:
   - SeedPhraseBackupPage.tsx
   - RestoreWalletPage.tsx
   - App.tsx
   - PaneManager.tsx

However, the infinite loop issue persisted, especially in App.tsx.

## Final Solution

After the shallow equality approach did not fully resolve the issue, I implemented a more radical solution for App.tsx:

1. **Completely refactored App.tsx to avoid Zustand hooks in the render cycle**:
   - Removed all Zustand hook calls from the component
   - Created a function outside the component to check wallet setup needs
   - Used direct store access with `getState()` instead of hooks
   - Added a timeout to schedule state updates outside the current call stack
   - Used a module-level flag to ensure the check only happens once

```typescript
// Check if wallet setup is needed and handle it outside of the component render cycle
// This completely removes the store access from the component rendering
let hasCheckedWalletSetup = false;

function checkWalletSetupNeeded() {
  if (hasCheckedWalletSetup) return;

  const isWalletInitialized = useWalletStore.getState().isInitialized;
  const panes = usePaneStore.getState().panes;

  if (!isWalletInitialized) {
    const setupPaneIsOpen = panes.some(
      (p) =>
        p.id === WALLET_SETUP_PANE_ID ||
        p.id === SEED_PHRASE_BACKUP_PANE_ID ||
        p.id === RESTORE_WALLET_PANE_ID,
    );

    if (!setupPaneIsOpen) {
      // Schedule this to happen outside the current call stack
      setTimeout(() => {
        usePaneStore.getState().openWalletSetupPane();
      }, 0);
    }
  }

  hasCheckedWalletSetup = true;
}

export default function App() {
  // Component code without Zustand hooks...

  // Use layout effect to ensure wallet setup is checked before render
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    checkWalletSetupNeeded();
  }, []);

  // Return component JSX...
}
```

## Explanation

The initial approach with shallow equality checking wasn't sufficient because there were still dependencies between multiple store hooks that were causing render cycles.

The root problem was that in App.tsx, we were using hooks to access multiple stores, and changes to one store would trigger re-renders that would cause the other store selectors to run again, creating a feedback loop.

By moving the wallet initialization check completely outside the component's render cycle and using direct store access with `getState()`, we've eliminated the dependency on React's hook system for this particular functionality. The `setTimeout` further ensures that state updates happen in a separate event loop tick, preventing them from interfering with the current render cycle.

This approach effectively "breaks the loop" by stopping the chain of store subscriptions -> render -> store subscriptions that was causing the infinite update cycle.
