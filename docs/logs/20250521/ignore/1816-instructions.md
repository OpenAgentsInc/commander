Okay, Agent! Let's tackle a few of these TypeScript errors to get some quick wins. We'll focus on common patterns and straightforward fixes.

**Underlying Theme for Many Errors:**

Many errors stem from:

1.  **Incomplete Mocks:** Mock objects (especially for `AiResponse`) don't fully satisfy the interfaces they're supposed to implement, particularly missing internal symbols or methods required by Effect's `Data.Case` or similar structures.
2.  **API Changes/Misuse:** Using deprecated methods (like `HttpClientResponse.empty`) or incorrect property names in constructors (like `message` instead of `description` for `HttpClientError.ResponseError`).
3.  **Test Setup:** Test layers not providing all necessary dependencies for the service under test, or test assertions not matching the actual (or intended corrected) service interface.

Here are specific instructions for a few error categories:

---

**Instruction Set 1: Fixing `AiResponse` Mock Errors**

*   **Files:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
*   **Errors:** TS2352 (Lines 86, 95, 104, 113 of the original error list) - `Property '[TypeId]' is missing...` and related errors for other symbols/methods.
*   **Problem:** The objects you're creating and casting `as AiResponse` are structurally incomplete. The `AiResponse` type from `@effect/ai` likely extends Effect's `Data.Case` (or similar patterns like `Equal.Equal`, `Hash.Hash`), which requires specific internal properties (`[TypeId]`, `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]`, `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]`) and methods (`withToolCallsJson`, `withToolCallsUnknown`, `concat`).
*   **Instructions:**

    For each of the four places in `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` where you have an object literal being cast `as AiResponse` (inside `Effect.succeed` or `Effect.map`):

    1.  **Ensure Required Properties:**
        *   Add `role: "assistant"` (or an appropriate role string).
        *   Add `parts: [{ _tag: "text", content: "YOUR_TEXT_HERE" } as const]` (or an empty array `[]` if no parts are relevant for the mock, but the property must exist if the type demands it). The type `AiMessagePart` usually has a `_tag`.
    2.  **Add Method Stubs:**
        *   `withToolCallsJson: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse)`
        *   `withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse)`
        *   `concat: (_other: AiResponse) => ({} as unknown as AiResponse)`
        *   **Important for stubs:** The object returned by these stubs must *also* be a minimally valid `AiResponse` mock if they are typed to return `AiResponse`. For simplicity in mocks, you might get away with `as any` or `as unknown as AiResponse` for the *return value* of these stubs if full fidelity isn't needed for the specific test path.
    3.  **Add Effect Data Symbols:**
        *   `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false`
        *   `[Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0`
    4.  **Final Cast:** After adding these, TypeScript might still complain about `[TypeId]`. Use the suggested cast: `} as unknown as AiResponse)`.

    **Example for the block starting at line 86 (and apply similarly to others):**

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts

    // Existing code around line 86:
    // Effect.succeed({
    //   text: "{}",
    //   structured: {}, // This might be an issue if AiResponse doesn't have 'structured' directly
    //   usage: { total_tokens: 0 },
    //   imageUrl: "",   // This too, check AiResponse structure
    //   content: [],    // This too
    // } as AiResponse),

    // Corrected Structure:
    Effect.succeed({
      text: "{}", // The primary text content
      usage: { total_tokens: 0 },
      // Ensure these fields are part of AiResponse or an AiMessagePart within `parts`
      // If `structured`, `imageUrl`, `content` are not direct properties of AiResponse,
      // they should be part of an AiMessagePart in the `parts` array, or removed from here.
      // For a generic mock, focus on what AiResponse *requires*.

      // Required properties for AiResponse:
      role: "assistant", // Or appropriate role
      parts: [
        { _tag: "text", content: "{}" } as const, // Minimal part, assuming AiMessagePart structure
        // If `structured` was meant to be a part:
        // { _tag: "structured", data: {} } as const, // Example
      ],

      // Method stubs
      withToolCallsJson: () => {
        // This stub must also return something AiResponse-like
        return {
          text: "", usage: { total_tokens: 0 }, role: "assistant", parts: [],
          withToolCallsJson: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          withToolCallsUnknown: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          concat: () => ({} as unknown as AiResponse),
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
          [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
        } as unknown as AiResponse;
      },
      withToolCallsUnknown: () => { /* similar stub */ } as unknown as AiResponse,
      concat: (_other: AiResponse) => { /* similar stub */ } as unknown as AiResponse,

      // Effect Data symbols
      [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Equal")]: () => false,
      [Symbol.for("@effect/data/Hash")]: () => 0,
    } as unknown as AiResponse),
    ```
    **Verification:** Check the definition of `AiResponse` in `node_modules/@effect/ai/dist/dts/AiResponse.d.ts` (path might vary slightly) to confirm its exact structure and required fields/methods.

**Instruction Set 2: Fixing `HttpClientResponse.make` (formerly `.empty`)**

*   **Files:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`
*   **Errors:** TS2339 (Lines 171, 186, 201, 277, 321, 349, 379 from your error list) - `Property 'make' does not exist on type 'typeof import(...HttpClientResponse")'.` (This contradicts previous logs where `.empty` was changed to `.make`).
*   **Problem Clarification:**
    *   The original error was likely `Property 'empty' does not exist...`.
    *   The fix `HttpClientResponse.make({ status: CODE })` is generally correct for newer `@effect/platform`.
    *   If `.make` is *now* reported as not existing, it strongly suggests an import issue or a very unusual version mismatch.
*   **Instructions:**

    1.  **Verify Import:** Ensure `HttpClientResponse` is imported correctly. The standard way is:
        ```typescript
        import * as HttpClientResponse from "@effect/platform/HttpClientResponse";
        ```
        Or, if your `tsconfig.json` and project structure allow direct named imports from `@effect/platform`:
        ```typescript
        import { HttpClientResponse } from "@effect/platform";
        ```
    2.  **Confirm Usage:** The usage `HttpClientResponse.make({ status: CODE })` is correct.
    3.  **Check `@effect/platform` version:** In `package.json`, you have `@effect/platform": "^0.82.2"`. This version *should* have `HttpClientResponse.make`.
    4.  **Suspicion:** The error might be a red herring or a misinterpretation. The prior fix to use `.make` was likely correct.
        *If this error persists exactly as "Property 'make' does not exist...", it might be that the `HttpClientResponse` variable in scope is not the module itself but a type or a different variable. Double-check imports at the top of `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`.*

    **Action (assuming the import is `import * as HttpClientResponse from "@effect/platform/HttpClientResponse";`):**
    The lines like `response: HttpClientResponse.make({ status: 500 }),` should be correct. If the error remains, provide the exact import statement for `HttpClientResponse` from that file.

**Instruction Set 3: Fixing `HttpClientError.ResponseError` Constructor**

*   **Files:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`
*   **Errors:** TS2353 (Lines 174, 192, 207, 280, 324, 352, 385 of error list) - `'message' does not exist... did you mean 'description'`.
*   **Problem:** The constructor for `HttpClientError.ResponseError` expects the error message in a field named `description`, not `message`.
*   **Instructions:**
    For all indicated lines where you construct `new HttpClientError.ResponseError(...)`:
    Rename the `message:` property to `description:`. Ensure the value is a string.

    **Example for line 174 (and apply similarly to others):**

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts
    //...
    return new HttpClientError.ResponseError({
        request: HttpClientRequest.get("ollama-ipc-nonstream"), // Or the actual request
        response: HttpClientResponse.make({ status: 500 }),    // Corrected from .empty
        reason: "StatusCode", // Or other valid HttpClientErrorReason
        cause: providerError, // Pass the original error as cause
        // message: providerError.message, // OLD
        description: String(providerError.message), // NEW - ensure it's a string
    });
    //...
    ```

**Instruction Set 4: Fixing Test File Issues in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts`**

*   **File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts`
*   **Errors:**
    *   TS2339 (Lines 64, 65, 66, 147): `Property 'chat' does not exist on type 'Client'.`
    *   TS2345 (Line 157): `Argument of type 'Effect<unknown, unknown, unknown>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Effect<unknown, unknown, never>'.`

*   **Instructions:**

    1.  **Fix Test Assertions for `client.chat` (Lines 64, 65, 66, 147):**
        *   The `OpenAiClient.Service` (which `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` represents) has a structure like:
            ```
            {
              client: GeneratedClient, // GeneratedClient has chat.completions.create
              stream: (params) => Stream,
              streamRequest: (params) => Stream
            }
            ```
        *   When you resolve the service `const client = yield* _(OllamaOpenAIClientTag);`, `client` is this service object.
        *   Your tests need to access the non-streaming methods via `client.client.chat.completions.create`.
        *   Update your assertions:
            ```typescript
            // Line 64:
            // expect(client.client.chat).toHaveProperty("completions"); // OLD, assuming 'client' is the resolved service
            const resolvedClient = yield* _(OllamaOpenAIClientTag); // First, resolve the service
            expect(resolvedClient.client.chat).toHaveProperty("completions"); // NEW

            // Line 65:
            expect(resolvedClient.client.chat.completions).toHaveProperty("create");

            // Line 66:
            expect(typeof resolvedClient.client.chat.completions.create).toBe("function");

            // Line 147 (inside a test program):
            // const result = yield* _(client.client.chat.completions.create({ ... }));
            ```

    2.  **Fix `R` Channel for Test Layer (Line 157):**
        *   The `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` layer depends on `TelemetryService`. You need to provide a mock for this in your test layer.
        *   **Mock `TelemetryService`:**
            ```typescript
            // At the top of your test file or in a test setup file
            import { TelemetryService } from "@/services/telemetry";
            import { Layer } from "effect";

            const mockTelemetryService: TelemetryService = {
              trackEvent: vi.fn(() => Effect.succeed(undefined as void)),
              isEnabled: vi.fn(() => Effect.succeed(true)),
              setEnabled: vi.fn(() => Effect.succeed(undefined as void)),
            };
            const MockTelemetryServiceLayer = Layer.succeed(TelemetryService, mockTelemetryService);
            ```
        *   **Provide the mock to `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` in your test:**
            ```typescript
            // Line 157: program.pipe(Effect.provide(OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive)) // OLD

            const testLayer = OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.pipe(
              Layer.provide(MockTelemetryServiceLayer)
            );
            // program.pipe(Effect.provide(testLayer)) // NEW, in Effect.runPromise
            // For the Effect.runPromiseExit call on line 157:
            Effect.runPromiseExit(
              program.pipe(Effect.provide(testLayer))
            )
            ```

After applying these changes, re-run `pnpm t`. This should address a significant number of the listed errors. Report the remaining errors for the next round of fixes.
