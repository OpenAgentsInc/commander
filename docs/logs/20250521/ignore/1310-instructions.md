Okay, I've identified the problem based on the logs and the common pitfalls associated with `useSyncExternalStore`, which is used internally by state management libraries like Zustand.

**Problem Identification:**

The key log lines are:

1.  `WalletSetupPage.tsx:13 The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop`
    - This warning is directly from React's `useSyncExternalStore` hook, which is the foundation for how Zustand subscribes to store changes. It means the function providing the "snapshot" of the store's state (or a selected part of it) is returning a new object/array reference on every call, even if the underlying data hasn't changed.
2.  `PaneManager.tsx:105 Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.`
    - This error is a consequence of the first warning. The `WalletSetupPage` component is likely re-rendering, causing its store selector to run again, returning a new reference, which React sees as a state change, triggering another re-render, and so on.
3.  The stack traces point to `useStore` and `useBoundStore` (common in Zustand) being called from `WalletSetupPage.tsx` at line 13.

This pattern strongly indicates that a selector function used with a Zustand store hook in `WalletSetupPage.tsx` at line 13 is creating a new object or array on every render. React's `useSyncExternalStore` then sees this new reference as a state change, causing an infinite re-render loop.

**Specific Instructions to the Coding Agent:**

You need to modify `src/pages/WalletSetupPage.tsx` to ensure that when it subscribes to the Zustand store (likely `useWalletStore` or a similar custom hook based on Zustand), the selected state does not cause unnecessary re-renders. This is typically achieved by using a shallow equality check for selectors that return objects or arrays.

1.  **Navigate to the file:** `src/pages/WalletSetupPage.tsx`.
2.  **Locate the Zustand store hook call:** Find the line (around line 13, as indicated by the log) where `useWalletStore` (or a similar hook like `useStore`, `useBoundStore`) is being used. It will look something like this:
    ```typescript
    // Example of a problematic hook call:
    const { propA, propB, propC } = useWalletStore((state) => ({
      propA: state.propA,
      propB: state.propB,
      propC: state.propC,
    }));
    // Or, if selecting an entire slice that's an object/array:
    // const someObjectSlice = useWalletStore(state => state.someObjectSlice);
    ```
3.  **Apply `shallow` equality check:**

    - Import the `shallow` equality checker from Zustand:
      ```typescript
      import { shallow } from "zustand/shallow";
      ```
    - Modify the store hook call to include `shallow` as the equality function. This tells Zustand to only re-render the component if the shallowly compared properties of the selected object (or elements of the array) have changed.

      - If the hook call is `const data = useWalletStore(selector);`, change it to:
        ```typescript
        const data = useWalletStore(selector, shallow);
        ```
      - So, for the example above, it would become:

        ```typescript
        // In src/pages/WalletSetupPage.tsx
        import { shallow } from "zustand/shallow"; // Make sure this import is added

        // ...

        // Example fix:
        const { propA, propB, propC } = useWalletStore(
          (state) => ({
            propA: state.propA,
            propB: state.propB,
            propC: state.propC,
          }),
          shallow,
        ); // <-- Added shallow here

        // Or if it was:
        // const someObjectSlice = useWalletStore(state => state.someObjectSlice, shallow);
        ```

4.  **Verify:** The infinite loop should be resolved. The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error and the "getSnapshot should be cached" warning related to `WalletSetupPage.tsx` should no longer appear in the console when the app starts.

This change ensures that `WalletSetupPage.tsx` only re-renders when the actual values of the properties it's interested in from the store change, not just when the selector function creates a new object reference for the same data.
