# Fix for Infinite Update Loop in PaneManager and Wallet Components

## Problem

The app was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error, which was traced to an infinite update loop originating in `PaneManager.tsx` and `WalletSetupPage.tsx`. The console warning "The result of getSnapshot should be cached" indicated that these components were creating new object references on every render when using Zustand stores, leading to an infinite re-rendering cycle.

## Solution

The solution is to use Zustand's shallow equality checking for store selectors that return objects. Specifically, we used `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow` (instead of `shallow` from `zustand/shallow`) to properly type our selectors. This ensures that components only re-render when the actual values of the selected state change, not just because a new object reference was created by the selector.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Modify `src/panes/PaneManager.tsx`:

- Added import for `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`
- Applied `useShallow` wrapper to the selector function in `usePaneStore` hook

### 2. Modify `src/pages/WalletSetupPage.tsx`:

- Added import for `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`
- Applied `useShallow` wrapper to selectors in both `useWalletStore` and `usePaneStore` hooks
- Fixed disable condition for the "Restore Existing Wallet" button by also disabling when `isGenerating` is true

### 3. Modify `src/pages/SeedPhraseBackupPage.tsx`:

- Added import for `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`
- Applied `useShallow` wrapper to the selector in `useWalletStore` hook
- Changed `usePaneStore` single function selector to use a simple direct access pattern without `useShallow`
- Added `useCallback` for all handler functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed the `onCheckedChange` handler for the checkbox to properly handle the checked state

### 4. Modify `src/pages/RestoreWalletPage.tsx`:

- Added import for `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`
- Applied `useShallow` wrapper to selectors in both `useWalletStore` and `usePaneStore` hooks
- Added `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Created a dedicated `handleBackToSetup` callback function instead of an inline function

## Technical Details

The root issue was related to how React's `useSyncExternalStore` (which Zustand uses internally) handles selectors:

1. When a selector function returns a new object reference on every render (like `(state) => ({ prop1: state.prop1, prop2: state.prop2 }))`), React thinks the state has changed.
2. This triggers a re-render, which in turn causes the selector to be called again, creating another new object reference.
3. This creates an infinite loop of re-renders, eventually exceeding React's maximum update depth.

Initially, we attempted to use `shallow` from `zustand/shallow` as a second argument to the store hook, but this caused TypeScript errors because it lost type information about the store's state. The errors included:

- `Property 'X' does not exist on type 'unknown'`
- `Expected 0-1 arguments, but got 2`

The correct solution was to use `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow` which wraps the selector function while preserving type information. This approach both prevents the infinite re-render loop and maintains proper TypeScript typing:

```typescript
// Before (causes infinite update loop):
const { x, y } = useStore((state) => ({ x: state.x, y: state.y }));

// After (with proper typing and equality checking):
const { x, y } = useStore(useShallow((state) => ({ x: state.x, y: state.y })));
```

For single-property selectors, we don't need the shallow equality check since primitive values are compared by value:

```typescript
// Simple selector that doesn't need shallow comparison:
const x = useStore((state) => state.x);
```

## Expected Result

After these changes:

1. The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error should be resolved
2. The components should only re-render when their actual state values change
3. The app should initialize properly without entering an infinite update loop

These changes maintain the functionality of the components while ensuring they operate efficiently within React's rendering model.
