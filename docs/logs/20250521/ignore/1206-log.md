# Wallet Management System Implementation

This log documents the implementation of a seed phrase-based wallet management system for Commander, based on the instructions in `1206-instructions.md`.

## Project Analysis

Before implementing the features, I analyzed the existing codebase:

1. BIP39Service:
   - Has the required methods: `generateMnemonic`, `validateMnemonic`, and `mnemonicToSeed`
   - Uses Effect.js for all operations with proper error handling

2. SparkService:
   - Has a configuration interface that includes `mnemonicOrSeed` parameter
   - Service configuration layer used in `runtime.ts` to provide SparkService
   - Current implementation appears to use a default static mnemonic

3. Existing Wallet Functionality:
   - A `WalletPane.tsx` component already exists with basic Bitcoin/Lightning functionality 
   - The wallet is accessible from the Hotbar with a Wallet icon
   - No explicit seed phrase management, settings, or wallet initialization/restoration

4. Router Setup:
   - Uses TanStack router with a simple setup
   - Need to add wallet setup/backup/restore routes

## Implementation Plan

Based on the instructions and codebase analysis, I'll implement:

1. Create a Zustand wallet store for managing wallet state
2. Create the wallet setup page for new wallet creation/restoration
3. Create the seed phrase backup page
4. Create the restore wallet page 
5. Create dialog components for wallet management
6. Update router configuration
7. Create unit tests

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Wallet Store Implementation

First, I created the wallet store to manage the wallet state. The primary goal is to provide:

- Seed phrase management (generation, validation, storage)
- Wallet initialization status
- Self-custody notice tracking
- Service initialization with the provided seed

Implementation notes:
- Store implemented in `src/stores/walletStore.ts` 
- Used Zustand with persist middleware for safe storage
- Core state includes seedPhrase, isInitialized, isLoading, error, hasSeenSelfCustodyNotice
- Key actions:
  - `generateNewWallet()`: Generates a new seed phrase using BIP39Service, returns it for display but doesn't store it yet
  - `_initializeWalletWithSeed()`: Internal action for when a user confirms backup or restore, sets the seed and initializes services
  - `restoreWallet()`: Validates and initializes a wallet from an existing seed phrase
  - `logout()`: Clears wallet state
  - `setHasSeenSelfCustodyNotice()`: Tracks if the user has seen the custody warning
- Storage persists only the necessary information: seedPhrase, isInitialized, hasSeenSelfCustodyNotice
- Added `onRehydrateStorage` handler to reinitialize services when the app loads with an existing wallet

### 2. Dialog Components Implementation

Next, I created three key dialog components:

- `SelfCustodyNoticeDialog`: Important notice shown when a new wallet is created or restored
  - Rendered after backup confirmation or successful restore (if user hasn't seen it before)
  - Uses Alert component with informative text about self-custody wallet responsibility
  - "I Understand" button tracks that the user has seen the notice

- `LogoutWarningDialog`: Warning dialog shown when user attempts to logout
  - Strong warning about securing seed phrase before logout
  - Options to Cancel or "Logout Anyway"
  - Navigates to setup page after logout

- `ViewSeedPhraseDialog`: Secure dialog for viewing the seed phrase
  - Accessible via "View Seed Phrase" button in the WalletPane
  - Retrieves seed phrase from the wallet store
  - Includes secure copy-to-clipboard functionality

### 3. Wallet Pages Implementation

I created three pages for wallet management:

- `WalletSetupPage`: Initial screen if no wallet is set up
  - Options to "Create New Wallet" or "Restore Existing Wallet"
  - Calls walletStore.generateNewWallet() when creating new wallet
  - Navigates to backup page with generated seed phrase

- `SeedPhraseBackupPage`: Displays a new seed phrase for backup
  - Shows the 12 words in a numbered grid format
  - Security warnings about protecting the seed phrase
  - Requires checkbox confirmation that user has backed up the phrase
  - Initializes wallet with the seed once backup is confirmed
  - Shows self-custody notice when appropriate

- `RestoreWalletPage`: Interface for entering an existing seed phrase
  - Text area for entering seed
  - Validates seed format using BIP39Service
  - Initializes wallet if seed is valid
  - Shows self-custody notice for first-time users

### 4. Updated Existing Wallet Component

Modified the existing WalletPane component:
- Added "View Seed Phrase" and "Logout" buttons at the top of the pane
- Connected them to the appropriate dialogs
- Used the useWalletStore hook to check initialization status

### 5. Router Configuration

Updated the TanStack Router setup:
- Added routes for `/setup-wallet`, `/backup-seed-phrase`, and `/restore-wallet`
- Modified root route component to check wallet initialization status:
  - If wallet is not initialized and not on setup routes, redirects to setup
  - If wallet is initialized and on setup route, redirects to home page

### 6. Integration

- Updated component exports in `components/wallet/index.ts`
- Used URL query parameters to safely pass seed phrase during initialization
- Ensured seamless transitions between views based on wallet state

### 7. Unit Tests

Created basic unit tests for the wallet store in `src/tests/unit/stores/walletStore.test.ts`:
- Tests initial state
- Tests wallet generation
- Tests wallet initialization
- Tests wallet restoration
- Tests logout functionality
- Tests seed phrase access and management
- Tests self-custody notice tracking

The implementation follows a secure approach to wallet creation and management with appropriate validations, warnings, and confirmation steps. Storing the seed in localStorage is a security concern in a production implementation (it should be encrypted), but for this implementation, we focused on the user flow and functionality.

- `src/components/wallet/index.ts` - Updated exports
- `src/routes/routes.tsx` - Added new wallet-related routes
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` - Added wallet initialization check and redirects

## Security Considerations

This implementation includes several security best practices:
- No automatic storage of seed phrase until explicitly confirmed by user
- Explicit backup confirmation required
- Warning dialogs for important actions
- Self-custody notice to educate users

However, there are some limitations in this implementation:
- Seed phrase is stored in localStorage in plaintext
- In a production environment, the seed phrase should be encrypted
- The initialization of services (like SparkService) with the new seed is mocked
  - In a real implementation, this would require deeper integration with the
    runtime and service layer to properly initialize with the user's seed
