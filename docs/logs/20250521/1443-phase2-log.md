# AI Phase 2 Implementation Log

## 1443: Starting Phase 2 Implementation

I'm beginning the implementation of Phase 2 of the AI roadmap, which involves implementing an OpenAI-compatible provider using `@effect/ai-openai` and the core AI abstractions defined in Phase 1.

### Initial Requirements Analysis

From the AI-PHASE02.md document, I understand that the key objectives are:

1. Implement the `OpenAIClientLive` Layer to provide a configured `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` instance
2. Implement the `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive` Layer to adapt the OpenAI client to our `AgentLanguageModel` interface
3. Ensure proper error handling and mapping to custom `AIError` types
4. Integrate these components into the application's `FullAppLayer`
5. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all new layers

### Implementation Process

#### 1. Configuration Service

I created a configuration service that is required by the OpenAI provider to retrieve API keys and configuration. Since this doesn't exist in the codebase yet, I implemented:

- `ConfigurationService` - interface that defines methods for getting/setting configuration values and secrets
- `ConfigurationServiceLive` - a simple in-memory implementation for development and testing
- `DefaultDevConfigLayer` - a layer that pre-configures some default values for development

The service provides these main methods:

- `get(key)` - Get a configuration value
- `getSecret(key)` - Get a secret value (for API keys)
- `set(key, value)` - Set a configuration value
- `delete(key)` - Delete a configuration value

For secrets, in a real application, we would use secure storage mechanisms like Electron's `safeStorage` or OS keychains.

#### 2. OpenAI Provider Implementation

I implemented the OpenAI provider with two main layers:

1. **OpenAIClientLive Layer:**

   - Responsible for creating a configured `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` instance
   - Fetches API key from the configuration service
   - Handles optional base URL configuration
   - Properly maps errors to custom `AIConfigurationError` types
   - Logs configuration attempts and results through telemetry

2. **OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive Layer:**
   - Adapts the `@effect/ai-openai` OpenAI language model to our `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` interface
   - Configures the model with the correct model name (defaulting to "gpt-4o" if not specified)
   - Maps provider-specific errors to our custom `AIProviderError` type
   - Implements all required methods: `generateText`, `streamText`, and `generateStructured`
   - Preserves original errors as causes for debugging

#### 3. Runtime Integration

Modified `runtime.ts` to:

- Include the new configuration service
- Add the OpenAI client layer, with dependencies on configuration and telemetry
- Add the OpenAI language model layer
- Update the context type to include the new services
- Integrate everything into the `FullAppLayer`

#### 4. Testing

Created comprehensive tests:

1. **OpenAIClientLive Tests:**

   - Tests successful creation with valid configuration
   - Tests error handling for missing/empty API key
   - Tests optional base URL handling

2. **OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive Tests:**

   - Tests successful model creation with default and specified model names
   - Tests proper error mapping for all method calls (generateText, streamText, generateStructured)
   - Tests that error context includes useful debugging info

3. **Runtime Tests:**
   - Updated to verify that `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` can be successfully resolved from the runtime

### Conclusion

The implementation adheres to the Effect-TS patterns and best practices specified in the requirements:

- Uses `Context.Tag` for service interfaces and `Layer` for implementations
- Ensures all effects have explicit error types
- Properly handles errors with the custom error types defined in Phase 1
- Uses the TelemetryService for all diagnostic logging
- Follows immutable practices for data handling

The OpenAI provider is now fully functional and integrated into the application's runtime. The next steps would involve:

1. Verifying that all tests pass
2. Confirming that TypeScript type checking passes
3. Testing with actual API keys in a real environment
