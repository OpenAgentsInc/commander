# AI Phase 2 Implementation Log

## 1443: Starting Phase 2 Implementation

I'm beginning the implementation of Phase 2 of the AI roadmap, which involves implementing an OpenAI-compatible provider using `@effect/ai-openai` and the core AI abstractions defined in Phase 1.

### Initial Requirements Analysis

From the AI-PHASE02.md document, I understand that the key objectives are:

1. Implement the `OpenAIClientLive` Layer to provide a configured `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` instance
2. Implement the `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive` Layer to adapt the OpenAI client to our `AgentLanguageModel` interface
3. Ensure proper error handling and mapping to custom `AIError` types
4. Integrate these components into the application's `FullAppLayer`
5. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all new layers

I'll now proceed with the implementation of these tasks.
