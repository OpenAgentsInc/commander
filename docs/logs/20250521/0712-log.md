# Commander Log - 2025-05-21 - Fixes to TypeScript errors

Following the instructions in `0712-instructions.md`, I'll continue fixing the remaining TypeScript errors in preparation for creating a PR.

## Service Layer Refactoring - Rationale

The refactoring of the Nostr services follows the principle of separation of concerns:

1. **NostrService**: Now focuses solely on core NIP-01 functionality (relay connections, basic pub/sub)
   - Removed `listPublicNip90Events` as it's not a core Nostr function but rather a specific NIP-90 use case
   - Refactored to use `createNostrServiceEffect` for proper dependency injection of TelemetryService via Effect.js context
   - Fixed issues with method context binding and type parameters

2. **NIP90Service**: Contains all NIP-90 specific functionality
   - Added `listPublicEvents` to handle retrieval of NIP-90 events
   - Properly depends on NostrService for relay interactions
   - Maintains its own specific error types and handling

## TypeScript Error Fixes

### 1. Fix Fiber API usage in Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts

The primary issue is that `unsafePoll` is a method on a fiber instance, not a static method:

```typescript
// Change from
if (!invoiceCheckFiber || Option.isSome(Fiber.unsafePoll(invoiceCheckFiber))) {
// To
if (!invoiceCheckFiber || Option.isSome(invoiceCheckFiber.unsafePoll())) {
```

And similarly:

```typescript
// Change from
if (invoiceCheckFiber && Option.isNone(Fiber.unsafePoll(invoiceCheckFiber))) {
// To
if (invoiceCheckFiber && Option.isNone(invoiceCheckFiber.unsafePoll())) {
```

### 2. Fix Service Import in Kind5050DVMService.test.ts

Changing the import to use the index file which re-exports the Layer:

```typescript
// From
import { Kind5050DVMService, Kind5050DVMServiceLive, ... } from '@/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMService';
// To
import { Kind5050DVMService, Kind5050DVMServiceLive, ... } from '@/services/dvm';
```

### 3. Fix Mock Service Implementations

In Kind5050DVMService.test.ts:
- Removed `listModels` from `mockOllamaService` as it's not in the interface
- Changed `created_at` to `created` with proper timestamp format
- Removed `getNodeInfo` from `mockSparkService` as it's not in the interface
- Fixed LightningInvoice structure by wrapping fields in an `invoice` object

### 4. Update NostrService Tests

- Removed tests for `listPublicNip90Events` as this method has been moved to NIP90Service
- Updated imports and Layer setup for NostrService tests
- Fixed Effect type parameters to ensure proper type safety

### 5. Fix Missing NIP90ServiceError Import

Added the import to NIP90ServiceImpl.ts:

```typescript
import {
  NIP90Service,
  // ... other imports ...
  NIP90ServiceError // Added this
} from './NIP90Service';
```

### 6. Fix Vitest Mock Type

Changed Vi.Mock to the correct type import:

```typescript
import type { Mock } from 'vitest';
// ...
(useQuery as Mock).mockReturnValue({...});
```

## Summary of Changes

The TypeScript fixes address several categories of issues:

1. **API Changes**: Fixed usage of Effect.js APIs that have changed (Fiber.isDone â†’ fiber.unsafePoll())
2. **Import Paths**: Updated imports to use the correct module paths (especially for Layers)
3. **Mock Implementations**: Fixed mocks to match the actual interfaces they're mocking
4. **Type Parameters**: Ensured Effect type parameters are correctly specified (especially R=never)
5. **Test Updates**: Updated tests to reflect the architectural changes (method moves between services)

These changes ensure that the codebase is now type-safe and follows best practices for Effect.js usage.
