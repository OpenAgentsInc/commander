# Fixing TypeScript Error TS2345 in OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

## Problem Analysis

I need to fix TypeScript errors in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` related to incompatible mock objects:

1. **Error 1**: The `mockClientService` object doesn't fully implement the `OpenAiClient.Service` interface. The error indicates that the `client` property has a nested structure (`client.chat.completions.create`) while the real interface uses a flat structure with direct methods (`client.createChatCompletion`).

2. **Error 2**: The `mockHttpClient` object only implements the `request` method, but the `HttpClient` interface requires several other methods like `execute`, `get`, `post`, etc.

## Implementation Plan

1. Restructure `mockClientService.client` to match the flat structure required by `Generated.Client` interface.
2. Add missing methods to `mockHttpClient` to fully implement the `HttpClient` interface.
3. Import necessary types from `@effect/ai-openai/Generated` for proper type checking.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Import Required Types

First, I'll add the necessary imports to the test file.

### Step 2: Fix the `mockClientService` Object

The `mockClientService` object needs to be restructured to have a flat structure instead of the nested one.

### Step 3: Implement the Full `HttpClient` Interface

The `mockHttpClient` object needs to implement all the methods required by the `HttpClient` interface.

## Changes Made

Let's start making the required changes to fix these TypeScript errors.
