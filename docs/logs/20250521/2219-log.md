# OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts TypeScript Error Fix

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the instructions and code, I can see that the issue is related to incorrect property access in the `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts` file. The test is trying to access methods using a nested structure (e.g., `client.chat.completions.create`), but the actual implementation uses a flat structure with methods directly on the client object (e.g., `client.createChatCompletion`).

This mismatch is causing TypeScript errors like `TS2339: Property 'chat' does not exist on type 'Client'`.

## Plan to Fix

1. Update the test file's expectations to use the flat structure
2. Modify the test that checks client structure to match the flat architecture
3. Update any function calls to use the correct method names and access patterns

## Implementation

Let me start by updating the test file:
