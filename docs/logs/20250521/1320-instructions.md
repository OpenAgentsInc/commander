Okay, the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error, especially with the stack trace pointing to `commitLayoutEffectOnFiber` and originating from your `<App>` component, strongly suggests that a `useLayoutEffect` hook is causing a state update which, in turn, triggers another re-render and re-execution of the layout effect in a loop.

The "radical approach" you took for `App.tsx` aimed to solve this by moving store reads (`getState()`) outside of React's render cycle and using a flag (`hasCheckedWalletSetup`) to ensure the logic runs only once. However, the core issue often lies in *when* and *how* state-updating actions are dispatched in relation to React's lifecycle phases.

**The Problem:**

In your refactored `App.tsx`, the function `checkWalletSetupNeeded` (which calls `usePaneStore.getState().openWalletSetupPane()`) is invoked within `useLayoutEffect`.

```typescript
// src/App.tsx
// ...
function checkWalletSetupNeeded() {
  // ...
  if (!setupPaneIsOpen) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      usePaneStore.getState().openWalletSetupPane(); // This updates the paneStore
    }, 0);
  }
  // ...
}

export default function App() {
  // ...
  useLayoutEffect(() => { // <--- Problematic for this kind of side-effect
    checkWalletSetupNeeded();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

`useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but *before* the browser has painted. If the `openWalletSetupPane()` action (even when scheduled with `setTimeout(..., 0)`) causes a state change in `paneStore` that leads to an immediate re-render of `App` or its children (like `PaneManager`), React might re-run layout effects too quickly, leading to the depth exceeded error. The `setTimeout` is an attempt to break this synchronous chain, but interactions with the rendering lifecycle can still be tricky.

**The Solution:**

For side effects that involve asynchronous operations or state updates that don't need to block browser paint (like opening a pane), `useEffect` is generally safer and more appropriate than `useLayoutEffect`. `useEffect` runs *after* the browser has painted.

The `hasCheckedWalletSetup` flag is crucial and correctly implemented to prevent the `openWalletSetupPane()` action from being dispatched multiple times. The issue is the timing and context of its first dispatch.

**Specific Instructions to Fix `App.tsx`:**

1.  **Modify `src/App.tsx` to use `useEffect` instead of `useLayoutEffect` for the `checkWalletSetupNeeded` call.**

    *   Change the import from React if `useLayoutEffect` is no longer used elsewhere in the file.
    *   Replace the `useLayoutEffect` hook with `useEffect`. The dependency array `[]` should remain, as this logic is intended to run once after the initial mount.

    **File: `src/App.tsx`**
    ```typescript
    // Before (if useLayoutEffect was the only layout hook):
    // import React, { useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from "react";
    // After:
    import React, { useEffect } from "react"; // Only useEffect needed for this specific logic
    // ... other imports ...
    import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
    import { TooltipProvider } from "./components/ui/tooltip";
    import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router"; // Assuming this is how RouterProvider is imported
    import { router } from "./routes/router"; // Assuming this is your router instance
    import { syncThemeWithLocal } from "./helpers/theme_helpers";
    import { updateAppLanguage } from "./helpers/language_helpers";
    import { useWalletStore } from "@/stores/walletStore";
    import { usePaneStore } from "@/stores/pane";
    import {
      WALLET_SETUP_PANE_ID,
      SEED_PHRASE_BACKUP_PANE_ID,
      RESTORE_WALLET_PANE_ID
    } from "@/stores/panes/constants";


    // Create a client for React Query
    const queryClient = new QueryClient();

    // checkWalletSetupNeeded function remains the same as in your last refactor:
    let hasCheckedWalletSetup = false;
    function checkWalletSetupNeeded() {
      if (hasCheckedWalletSetup) return;

      const isWalletInitialized = useWalletStore.getState().isInitialized;
      const panes = usePaneStore.getState().panes;

      if (!isWalletInitialized) {
        const setupPaneIsOpen = panes.some(p =>
          p.id === WALLET_SETUP_PANE_ID ||
          p.id === SEED_PHRASE_BACKUP_PANE_ID ||
          p.id === RESTORE_WALLET_PANE_ID
        );

        if (!setupPaneIsOpen) {
          setTimeout(() => {
            usePaneStore.getState().openWalletSetupPane();
          }, 0);
        }
      }
      hasCheckedWalletSetup = true;
    }

    export default function App() {
      const { i18n } = useTranslation();

      // Initial effects for theme and language (this useEffect is fine)
      useEffect(() => {
        syncThemeWithLocal();
        updateAppLanguage(i18n);
      }, [i18n]);

      // ---- MODIFICATION HERE ----
      // Change useLayoutEffect to useEffect for checking wallet setup
      useEffect(() => {
        checkWalletSetupNeeded();
      }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs once after initial mount

      return (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <TooltipProvider>
            <RouterProvider router={router} />
          </TooltipProvider>
        </QueryClientProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

**Explanation of Why This Should Work:**

*   By switching to `useEffect`, the `checkWalletSetupNeeded` function (and consequently the `openWalletSetupPane` action via `setTimeout`) will be executed *after* React has committed changes to the DOM and the browser has painted. This asynchronous nature is less likely to conflict with React's internal update cycle in a way that causes an immediate re-render loop caught by the "maximum update depth" guard.
*   The `hasCheckedWalletSetup` flag ensures that even if `App` re-renders for other reasons, the `openWalletSetupPane()` action will not be dispatched again by this effect.
*   The `App` component itself no longer directly subscribes to `paneStore` via hooks, so the `openWalletSetupPane()` action doesn't cause `App` to re-render *due to its own subscription*. Re-renders will be triggered by children (like `PaneManager`) that *do* subscribe to `paneStore`. This is the correct flow.

This change directly addresses the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when it's caused by synchronous state updates from `useLayoutEffect`.
