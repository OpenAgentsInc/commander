Okay, this application startup failure and the accompanying TypeScript errors indicate a critical mismatch between how your code is trying to use the `@effect/ai` and `@effect/ai-openai` libraries and how those libraries actually export their modules and types. The runtime crash `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'model') at OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts:31:73` is a direct symptom of these TypeScript issues.

Let's create specific instructions to address the TypeScript errors first, as they are foundational. Fixing these should resolve the runtime crash and pave the way for fixing the test failures.

**Primary Goal: Fix all TypeScript compilation errors.**

---

**Instruction Set 1: Fix TypeScript Errors in `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`**

This file has multiple TypeScript errors that are likely causing the runtime crash.

1.  **Error `TS2307: Cannot find module '@effect/ai/AiLanguageModel'` (and `AiModel`)**
    *   **File:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
    *   **Lines:** 19, 21 (from the provided TypeScript error log).
    *   **Reason:** The types `AiLanguageModel` and `AiModel` are being imported from incorrect subpaths. They are typically exported directly from the main `@effect/ai` package.
    *   **Action:**
        Modify the import statements for `EffectAiLanguageModel` (aliased from `AiLanguageModel`) and `AiModel`.
        Change:
        ```typescript
        // Old, problematic imports
        // import type { AiLanguageModel as EffectAiLanguageModel } from "@effect/ai/AiLanguageModel";
        // import type { AiModel } from "@effect/ai/AiModel";
        ```
        To:
        ```typescript
        // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts
        import type { AiLanguageModel as EffectAiLanguageModel, AiModel } from "@effect/ai";
        ```
        Ensure any other types from `@effect/ai` (like `AiResponse`, `AiTextChunk`) are also imported from `@effect/ai` directly, not subpaths, if they follow the same pattern. E.g., `import type { AiResponse } from "@effect/ai/AiResponse";` should become `import type { AiResponse } from "@effect/ai";`. (Review `OllamaAgentLanguageModel.ts` in `core` as well, which might be where `AiResponse` for the SUT is defined). The error log points specifically to `AiLanguageModel` and `AiModel` in the SUT.

2.  **Error `TS2339: Property 'OpenAiLanguageModel' does not exist on type 'typeof import("@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/OpenAiCompletions")'`**
    *   **File:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
    *   **Line:** 58 (from the provided TypeScript error log). This corresponds to the line `const aiModelEffectDefinition = OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName);` in your example SUT code.
    *   **Reason:** The `OpenAiLanguageModel` object (which contains the `.model()` factory) is not a property of the `OpenAiCompletions` namespace/module. It's typically a top-level export from `@effect/ai-openai`.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Modify the import from `@effect/ai-openai`:
            Change:
            ```typescript
            // import { OpenAiClient, OpenAiCompletions } from "@effect/ai-openai";
            ```
            To (ensure `OpenAiLanguageModel` is imported directly):
            ```typescript
            import { OpenAiClient, OpenAiLanguageModel } from "@effect/ai-openai";
            ```
            *(Note: If `OpenAiCompletions` was used for other purposes, keep it, but `OpenAiLanguageModel` needs to be a separate, direct import).*
        2.  Modify the usage:
            Change:
            ```typescript
            // const aiModelEffectDefinition = OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName);
            ```
            To:
            ```typescript
            const aiModelEffectDefinition = OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName);
            ```
        This change should also be applied to `src/services/ai/providers/openai/OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` if it uses the same incorrect pattern.

3.  **Error `TS2694: Namespace '"@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/OpenAiClient"' has no exported member 'Service'.`**
    *   **File:** `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
    *   **Line:** 71 (from the provided TypeScript error log). This likely refers to a type annotation like `AiModel<EffectAiLanguageModel, OpenAiClient.Service>`.
    *   **Reason:** The way `OpenAiClient.Service` (the type for the service) is accessed is incorrect relative to how `OpenAiClient` (the Tag) is imported.
    *   **Action:**
        If you import the Tag like `import { OpenAiClient } from "@effect/ai-openai";`, then `OpenAiClient` is the Tag itself. The associated service type is usually accessible via `OpenAiClient.Service`. The error message implies that the TypeScript compiler is looking at the *module path* rather than the imported Tag.
        To resolve this, ensure that `OpenAiClient` used in type position refers to the imported Tag, and that Tag indeed exposes a `.Service` type.
        The `@effect/ai-openai/OpenAiClient.d.ts` file defines:
        ```typescript
        export declare class OpenAiClient extends OpenAiClient_base {}
        export declare namespace OpenAiClient {
            interface Service { /* ... */ }
        }
        ```
        This structure means if you `import { OpenAiClient } from "@effect/ai-openai";`, then `OpenAiClient` is the Tag (class), and `OpenAiClient.Service` should be the type.
        If the error persists after fixing Instruction 1.2 (which changes how `OpenAiClient` might be imported or aliased), you might need to explicitly import the namespace if it's different from the Tag:
        ```typescript
        import { OpenAiClient as OpenAiClientTag } from "@effect/ai-openai"; // The Tag
        import type { OpenAiClient as OpenAiClientNamespace } from "@effect/ai-openai"; // The namespace for types
        // Then use OpenAiClientNamespace.OpenAiClient.Service for the type
        // However, typically, the service type is directly on the Tag: OpenAiClientTag.Service
        ```
        **First, try fixing Instruction 1.2.** This often clarifies such namespace issues. If `OpenAiLanguageModel` and `OpenAiClient` (the Tag) are both direct exports from `@effect/ai-openai`, the type `OpenAiClient.Service` should resolve correctly.

**Instruction Set 2: Fix TypeScript Errors in Test Files**

1.  **Error `TS2740: Type '{ createChatCompletion: Mock<Procedure>; }' is missing properties...` in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts`**
    *   **File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts`
    *   **Line:** 58 (from the provided TypeScript error log).
    *   **Reason:** The mock object for `OpenAiClient.Service["client"]` (which should implement `Generated.Client`) is incomplete.
    *   **Action:**
        As detailed in previous instructions (`2226-instructions.md` and confirmed in `2359-instructions.md` Phase 1), the `mockGeneratedClient` object in this test file **must be augmented to include stubs for all methods** defined in the `Generated.Client` interface (from `node_modules/@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/Generated.d.ts`). There are approximately 94 methods. Each missing method should be stubbed, for example:
        ```typescript
        // In src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts
        // within the mockGeneratedClient object:
        listAssistants: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: listAssistants")),
        createAssistant: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createAssistant")),
        // ... and so on for ALL ~94 methods.
        ```
        **This is tedious but necessary for type correctness of the mock.**

2.  **Error `TS2345: Argument of type 'Effect<...>' is not assignable to 'Effect<..., never>'` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`**
    *   **File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`
    *   **Line:** 90 (from the provided TypeScript error log).
    *   **Reason:** The `Effect` being provided to `Effect.runPromise` (or a similar runner like `runTestEffect`) still has unsatisfied context requirements (`R` channel is `unknown` instead of `never`). This means the `testLayerForOllamaAgentLM` is not providing all necessary dependencies.
    *   **Action:**
        The `testLayerForOllamaAgentLM` is defined as:
        ```typescript
        const testLayerForOllamaAgentLM = OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.pipe(
            Layer.provide(
                Layer.mergeAll(
                    MockOllamaOpenAIClient,     // Provides OllamaOpenAIClientTag
                    MockConfigurationService,   // Provides ConfigurationService
                    MockTelemetryService,       // Provides TelemetryService
                    MockHttpClient              // Provides HttpClient.HttpClient
                )
            )
        );
        ```
        The `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` SUT (after fixes from Instruction Set 1) will use the real `OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)`. This function, and the `OpenAiClient` it uses, ultimately depend on `HttpClient.HttpClient`. **Ensure `MockHttpClient` in your test file correctly and fully implements the `HttpClient.HttpClient` interface and is properly provided.**
        The error `TS2352` you fixed in `2241-log.md` for `MockHttpClient` was by using `as unknown as HttpClient`. While this silences the immediate error for the mock definition, it might not fully satisfy the type checker when this mock is *used* by library code expecting a perfectly conformed `HttpClient`.
        The `HttpClient.of(mockHttpClientMethods)` approach from `2241-instructions.md` is better.
        *   **Re-verify `MockHttpClient` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`:**
            Ensure `MockHttpClient` is created using `HttpClient.of(...)` with a complete set of method stubs for `HttpClient.Default`.
            ```typescript
            // In src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
            import { HttpClient } from "@effect/platform/HttpClient";
            // ...
            const mockHttpClientMethods = { /* all methods of HttpClient.Default stubbed */ };
            const mockHttpClientServiceInstance = HttpClient.of(mockHttpClientMethods);
            const MockHttpClient = Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClientServiceInstance);
            ```
        If `MockHttpClient` is correctly providing a fully-typed `HttpClient.HttpClient`, and all other dependencies (`OllamaOpenAIClientTag`, `ConfigurationService`, `TelemetryService`) are also correctly provided by their respective mock layers, this `R` channel mismatch should resolve.

---

**Execution Order:**

1.  Apply **Instruction Set 1** to `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`.
2.  Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false`. Report the output. The goal is for all errors in the SUT to be fixed. The runtime crash should also be fixed by this.
3.  Then, apply **Instruction Set 2** to the test files.
4.  Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false` again. Report output.
5.  Run `pnpm test`. Report the full test output.

Addressing the SUT's TypeScript errors first by using the libraries correctly is paramount. Then, ensuring the test mocks conform to the interfaces these libraries expect will resolve the test-time TypeScript errors and enable us to debug the runtime test failures more effectively.
