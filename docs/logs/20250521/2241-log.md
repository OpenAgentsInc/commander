# Fixing TS2352 Error in OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

## Task Overview
I need to fix the TypeScript error `TS2352` in the OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts file. The error is related to the mock `HttpClient` object not having the necessary Effect-TS symbols (`[TypeId]` and `[NodeInspectSymbol]`) required by the `HttpClient` interface.

## Current Implementation
Currently, the mock HttpClient is defined as a plain JavaScript object with various vi.fn() stubs for HTTP methods, but it lacks the Effect-specific type identifiers. It's being cast to `HttpClient` type when passed to `Layer.succeed()`, but TypeScript is still reporting type errors.

```typescript
const mockHttpClient = {
  request: vi.fn(...),
  // ... other methods ...
  pipe(): any { return this; },
  toJSON: vi.fn(() => ({ _tag: "MockHttpClient" })),
};

const MockHttpClient = Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClient as HttpClient);
```

## Solution
The solution is to use the `HttpClient.of()` method provided by the Effect framework to create a properly tagged service instance with the necessary symbols.

## Implementation Steps

1. Keep the existing methods in `mockHttpClient` but rename it to `mockHttpClientMethods` for clarity
2. Use `HttpClient.of()` to create a properly tagged service instance 
3. Update the `MockHttpClient` layer to use this properly tagged instance
4. Simplify the method signatures to match the actual return types used in the test

## Changes Made

1. Renamed `mockHttpClient` to `mockHttpClientMethods` to be more descriptive
2. Kept the same method implementations but simplified the `pipe` method 
3. Created a properly tagged service instance using `HttpClient.of(mockHttpClientMethods)`
4. Updated the `MockHttpClient` layer to use this properly tagged instance
5. Removed attempts to use `HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson` which wasn't available

```typescript
// Mock HttpClient for OpenAiLanguageModel with all required methods
const mockHttpClientMethods = {
  // Core request method
  request: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) => 
    Effect.succeed({ status: 200, body: {}, headers: new Headers() })),
  
  // HTTP method shortcuts
  execute: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) => 
    Effect.succeed({ status: 200, body: "execute mock", headers: new Headers() })),
  
  // ... other methods ...
  
  // Utility methods
  pipe() { 
    return this; 
  },
  toJSON: vi.fn(() => ({ _tag: "MockHttpClientMethods" })),
};

// Create the actual service instance that will have the Effect symbols
const mockHttpClientServiceInstance = HttpClient.of(mockHttpClientMethods);

const MockHttpClient = Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClientServiceInstance);
```

## Results

Confirmed that the original `TS2352` error related to missing Effect-TS symbols is now fixed. There are still other TypeScript errors in the file related to project configuration and module resolution, but those are outside the scope of this task.

The key fix was using `HttpClient.of()` to properly create a service instance with the necessary Effect-TS internal symbols, rather than casting a plain object to the `HttpClient` type.
