# Implementation Log for Task 2352

## Issue Analysis

After examining the new instructions in `2352-instructions.md`, I understand the root issue better:

1. The primary issue is with the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file where we have a mock implementation of `OpenAiLanguageModel.model`.
2. The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` occurs because the provider object or its methods (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateStructured`) are not properly returning Effect or Stream instances.
3. The secondary issue is that there are problems with the telemetry calls not being properly piped with `Effect.ignoreLogged`.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the detailed instructions, I'll implement the following changes:

1. Fix the `yield*` operations in the telemetry tracking calls to ensure they're properly piped.
2. Refine the local mock implementation of `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` to ensure it returns properly structured Effects.
3. Add defensive checks in the implementation to handle cases where the provider methods might not return valid Effects.

## Implementation

I'll update the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file following the approach outlined in the instructions.
