# 2315 Log - Fixing OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive TypeError

## Initial Assessment

I've been asked to fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` that occurs in `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`.

This error seems to be related to the incorrect resolution of the `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` in the implementation, which should return an `Effect` that resolves to a `Provider`. The error suggests that the current implementation isn't properly handling the two-stage resolution process.

## Current Implementation Analysis

After examining the current implementation in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`, I can see the root issue:

1. The file is not importing `OpenAiLanguageModel` from `@effect/ai-openai`. Line 10 only imports `OpenAiClient`.
2. Instead, there's a custom mock implementation of `OpenAiLanguageModel` defined in the file (lines 27-80).
3. While this mock attempts to simulate the two-stage resolution process of `AiModel` to `Provider`, it's not fully compatible with how the real library works, which is causing issues in the tests.

## Implementation Plan

According to the instructions, I need to:

1. Ensure correct import of `OpenAiLanguageModel` from `@effect/ai-openai`
2. Remove the local mock of `OpenAiLanguageModel`
3. Fix the two-step `AiModel` to `Provider` resolution process
4. Ensure error handling is robust

Let me implement these changes.
