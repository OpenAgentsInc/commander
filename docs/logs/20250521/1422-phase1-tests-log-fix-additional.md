# Additional Test Fix for Stream Processing

After the initial fixes, one test was still failing:

```
FAIL  src/tests/unit/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel.test.ts > AgentLanguageModel Service > Service methods > streamText should be callable and provide stream
```

## Stream Collection Issue

The main issue was with how Stream chunks were collected in the test. The previous approach wasn't correctly processing the stream.

### What was changed:

1. Created a mock stream explicitly and assigned it to the mock service method:
```typescript
// Create a simple stream with chunks directly
const mockStream = Stream.fromIterable([
  { text: "Mock " },
  { text: "stream " },
  { text: "response" }
] as AiTextChunk[]);

// Override the mock to return our predefined stream
mockService.streamText.mockReturnValue(mockStream);
```

2. Changed the stream processing approach to use `Stream.runCollect` for reliable collection:
```typescript
// Collect the stream chunks directly from the program
const chunks: AiTextChunk[] = [];
await Stream.runCollect(program.pipe(Effect.provide(testLayer)))
  .pipe(Effect.map(collected => {
    collected.forEach(chunk => chunks.push(chunk));
  }))
  .pipe(Effect.runPromise);
```

3. Changed the program creation to directly return the stream rather than wrapping it in another Effect:
```diff
- const program = Effect.flatMap(
-   AgentLanguageModel,
-   (service) => Effect.succeed(service.streamText(params))
- );
+ const program = Effect.flatMap(
+   AgentLanguageModel,
+   (service) => service.streamText(params)
+ );
```

With these changes, all tests now pass correctly. The stream handling now properly captures the mock stream chunks.

## Phase 2 Testing Guidelines Added

I've added comprehensive testing guidelines for Phase 2 (OpenAI-Compatible Provider Implementation) in a new file:
`/docs/AI-PHASE02-TESTS.md`

The document includes:

1. Two detailed test file implementations:
   - `OpenAIClientLive.test.ts` - Testing the creation and configuration of the OpenAI client
   - `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` - Testing the provider adapter that implements AgentLanguageModel

2. Integration testing for the runtime:
   - Adding a test case to verify that the OpenAI provider is correctly integrated in the FullAppLayer

3. Testing tips for:
   - Integration testing with real/mock OpenAI API
   - Effectively mocking the Effect AI packages
   - Thorough error testing
   - Configuration validation

Each test covers the critical functionality and error paths, including:
- API key configuration
- Model name configuration and defaults
- Error mapping from provider errors to our custom error types
- Stream error handling
- Structured output generation and error handling
