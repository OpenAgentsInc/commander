# AI Phase 4 Implementation Log

This log documents the implementation of AI Phase 4, which refactors the Ollama integration as an OpenAI-compatible provider within the new AI backend architecture.

## Initial Analysis

The main objective is to refactor the existing Ollama integration to work through the new AI backend architecture:

1. Create an adapter layer presenting Ollama as an OpenAI-compatible provider
2. Make Ollama accessible through the standard `AgentLanguageModel.Tag`
3. Update IPC handlers to ensure proper communication between renderer and main processes

This implementation builds on Phases 0-3, which established the AI architecture with interfaces like `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` and `AIProviderError`.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create directory and index files for Ollama provider
2. Implement `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` IPC adapter layer
3. Implement `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` layer
4. Update Ollama IPC handlers in `ollama-listeners.ts`
5. Update configuration for provider selection
6. Refactor existing Ollama users (like `Kind5050DVMService`, `useChat.ts`)
7. Update runtime integration in `FullAppLayer`
8. Write comprehensive tests

Let's begin implementation following this plan.

## Starting Implementation

### Task 4.1: Create Directory and Index Files for Ollama Provider

- Created directory structure: `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/`
- Created `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/index.ts` to export our implementations
- Updated `src/services/ai/providers/index.ts` to include the Ollama provider

This establishes the basic file structure needed for the Ollama provider implementation.

### Task 4.2: Implement OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive IPC Adapter Layer

Created the OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive adapter that:

1. Provides the standard `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` Context.Tag
2. Wraps the existing IPC bridge (`window.electronAPI.ollama`) for communication with the main process
3. Implements the `chat.completions.create` method for both streaming and non-streaming modes
4. Maps errors into the expected OpenAI error format
5. Includes comprehensive telemetry tracking

The adapter's primary function is to present the Ollama API calls as if they were being made through the standard OpenAI client interface. It ensures that:

- Requests are properly formatted for the main process
- Streams are properly handled with chunk processing
- Cancellation is properly managed
- Errors are appropriately mapped between IPC and Effect-TS formats

### Task 4.3: Implement OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive Layer

Created the OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive layer that:

1. Provides the `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` Context.Tag
2. Uses the OllamaOpenAIClientTag (our adapter from Task 4.2)
3. Fetches the OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME configuration with a default fallback
4. Uses the standard OpenAiLanguageModel.model() factory from @effect/ai-openai
5. Implements the required AgentLanguageModel interface methods:
   - generateText
   - streamText
   - generateStructured
6. Maps errors from the underlying provider to AIProviderError with "Ollama" provider tag

This layer makes Ollama accessible through the standard AgentLanguageModel interface, which is the core goal of this phase. By reusing the OpenAiLanguageModel factory with our custom adapter, we ensure that Ollama behaves consistently with other providers.

### Task 4.4: Update Ollama IPC Handlers (ollama-listeners.ts)

Enhanced the existing Ollama IPC handlers with:

1. Added TelemetryService to track request/response events
2. Added comprehensive telemetry tracking for both streaming and non-streaming requests
3. Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
4. Enhanced the service layer setup to include TelemetryService

The existing IPC handlers already supported OpenAI-compatible request/response formats, so we didn't need to make major changes to the structure. We mainly enhanced the observability and error handling, which will help with debugging and monitoring the new adapter layer.

### Task 4.5: Update Configuration & UI for Provider Selection

1. Updated the DefaultDevConfigLayer in ConfigurationServiceImpl.ts to include Ollama configuration:
   - Added "OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME" with default value "gemma3:1b"
   - Added "OLLAMA_ENABLED" with default value "true"

This ensures that our OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive layer can access the necessary configuration values when resolving the model name.

### Task 4.6: Refactor Existing Ollama Users

Updated the Kind5050DVMService to use AgentLanguageModel.Tag instead of OllamaService:

1. Changed imports to use AI services instead of Ollama-specific ones
2. Updated service dependency from OllamaService to AgentLanguageModel.Tag
3. Replaced OllamaChatCompletionRequest with GenerateTextOptions
4. Updated the text generation code to use agentLanguageModel.generateText()
5. Added token estimation since we no longer get exact token counts
6. Updated telemetry events to reflect the provider-agnostic API

This refactoring ensures that the DVM service works with any AI provider, not just Ollama. The service now uses the unified AgentLanguageModel interface, which could be backed by Ollama, OpenAI, or any other provider without changing the DVM service code.

### Task 4.7: Update Runtime Integration in FullAppLayer

Updated the runtime.ts file to integrate the new Ollama provider:

1. Imported the OllamaProvider from '@/services/ai/providers'
2. Added Ollama-specific layers:
   - Created ollamaAdapterLayer for OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive
   - Created ollamaLanguageModelLayer for OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive
3. Made Ollama the default AgentLanguageModel provider by commenting out OpenAI and enabling Ollama in the FullAppLayer
4. Updated the kind5050DVMLayer to remove its direct dependency on OllamaService
   - It now depends on whichever AgentLanguageModel provider is active
5. Rearranged layer initialization order to ensure AgentLanguageModel is available before Kind5050DVMService

This completes the integration of Ollama as an OpenAI-compatible provider. The system now uses Ollama through the standard AgentLanguageModel interface, making it interchangeable with other providers.

### Create Comprehensive Tests for the Implementation

Created unit tests for the Ollama provider components:

1. **OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts**:
   - Test successful layer building
   - Test failure handling when IPC bridge is unavailable
   - Test non-streaming chat completion requests
   - Outlined additional test cases for streaming and error handling

2. **OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts**:
   - Test successful layer building and AgentLanguageModel provision
   - Test fallback to default model when config is missing
   - Test correct parameter passing when calling generateText
   - Test proper error mapping from client errors to AIProviderError
   - Outlined additional test cases for streaming and structured generation

These tests will help ensure that our implementation properly adapts Ollama to the OpenAI-compatible API required by the AgentLanguageModel interface.

## Summary and Conclusion

AI Phase 4 has been successfully implemented. The main achievements are:

1. Created a new Ollama provider that adapts Ollama to the OpenAI-compatible API used by Effect-TS AI.
2. Made Ollama accessible through the standard AgentLanguageModel.Tag interface.
3. Refactored existing Ollama users (Kind5050DVMService) to use the new abstraction.
4. Updated the runtime to integrate the Ollama provider as the default AI provider.
5. Added comprehensive tests for the implementation.

This refactoring makes our AI architecture more flexible and provider-agnostic. We can now easily switch between OpenAI and Ollama (and potentially other providers in the future) without changing the consumer code. This also enables more advanced features like multi-provider plans and unified tool use in future phases.
