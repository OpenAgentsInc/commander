Okay, I will focus on the TypeScript error **`TS2352`** which indicates an issue with a mock `HttpClient` object not fully conforming to the `HttpClient` type, specifically missing `[TypeId]` and `[NodeInspectSymbol]`. This error occurs in the test file `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`.

**Error to Fix:**

*   **File:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`
*   **Error Code:** `TS2352`
*   **Error Message Snippet:** `Conversion of type '{ request: Mock<...>; ... }' to type 'HttpClient' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. ... Type '{...}' is missing the following properties from type 'With<HttpClientError, never>': [TypeId], [NodeInspectSymbol]`
    *(Note: The `With<HttpClientError, never>` part seems to be a misinterpretation by the compiler or a complex interaction; the primary issue is the mock object lacking Effect's service symbols.)*

**Understanding the Problem:**

The `HttpClient` service from `@effect/platform` is an Effect-TS service, typically tagged and constructed in a way that provides it with internal symbols like `[TypeId]` and `[NodeInspectSymbol]`. When creating a mock for such a service, a plain JavaScript object (even if it has all the same methods) might not satisfy TypeScript because it lacks these internal symbols that define its identity within the Effect ecosystem.

The test file `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` attempts to provide a mock `HttpClient` using `Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClientAsPlainObject)`. While `mockHttpClientAsPlainObject` might have all the necessary methods, it's still just a plain object.

**Instructions for the Coding Agent to Fix `TS2352`:**

The goal is to create a `mockHttpClientServiceInstance` that is recognized by TypeScript as a valid `HttpClient` service instance, complete with the necessary Effect-TS symbols.

1.  **Open the Target Test File:**
    Navigate to and open:
    `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`

2.  **Locate the `mockHttpClient` Object:**
    You currently have a `mockHttpClient` object defined as a plain JavaScript object with various `vi.fn()` stubs for HTTP methods. It looks something like this:
    ```typescript
    // Current mockHttpClient in OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
    const mockHttpClient = {
      request: vi.fn(...),
      execute: vi.fn(...),
      get: vi.fn(...),
      post: vi.fn(...),
      // ... other methods ...
      pipe(): any { return this; },
      toJSON: vi.fn(() => ({ _tag: "MockHttpClient" })),
    };
    ```

3.  **Import `HttpClient` Tag Correctly:**
    Ensure `HttpClient` (the Tag) is imported from `@effect/platform/HttpClient`.
    ```typescript
    import { HttpClient } from "@effect/platform/HttpClient";
    // Also ensure HttpClientRequest and HttpClientResponse are imported for method signatures
    import * as HttpClientRequest from "@effect/platform/HttpClientRequest";
    import * as HttpClientResponse from "@effect/platform/HttpClientResponse";
    ```

4.  **Define the Mock Methods Object:**
    Keep the existing object that defines the *implementations* of the `HttpClient` methods (your current `mockHttpClient`). Let's rename it for clarity (e.g., `mockHttpClientMethods`) and ensure it correctly implements the methods of `HttpClient.Default` (the service's actual interface shape).

    ```typescript
    const mockHttpClientMethods = {
      request: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) =>
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: {} }, req) // Make sure to return a valid HttpClientResponse
        )
      ),
      execute: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) =>
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: "execute mock" }, req)
        )
      ),
      get: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) =>
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `get ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.get(url, options))
        )
      ),
      post: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: any) => // HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `post ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.post(url, options))
        )
      ),
      put: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: any) => // HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `put ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.put(url, options))
        )
      ),
      patch: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: any) => // HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `patch ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.patch(url, options))
        )
      ),
      del: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: any) => // HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `delete ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.del(url, options))
        )
      ),
      head: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) =>
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `head ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.head(url, options))
        )
      ),
      options: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) =>
        Effect.succeed(
          HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `options ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.options(url, options))
        )
      ),
      pipe<B extends HttpClient.HttpClient.Default>(this: B, ab: (_: B) => B): B { // Ensure 'this' is typed if using it for pipe.
        return ab(this);
      },
      toJSON: vi.fn(() => ({ _tag: "MockHttpClientMethods" })), // Optional, for debugging
      // Ensure `preprocess` is present if it's part of the HttpClient.Default interface
      // preprocess: null as any, // or vi.fn().mockImplementation(req => Effect.succeed(req))
    };
    ```
    *Self-correction:* The `pipe` method is part of the `Pipeable` interface that `HttpClientDefault` extends. A simple implementation for a mock can be `pipe(this: any, f: any) { return f(this); }`. More accurately, it should reflect its actual signature from `Pipeable`.

5.  **Create the Mock Service Instance Using `HttpClient.of()`:**
    Use the `HttpClient.of()` constructor (which is part of the `HttpClient` Tag API) to create a properly tagged service instance from your mock methods.
    ```typescript
    // Create the actual service instance that will have the Effect symbols
    const mockHttpClientServiceInstance = HttpClient.of(mockHttpClientMethods);
    ```

6.  **Update the `MockHttpClient` Layer Definition:**
    Modify the `MockHttpClient` layer to use this properly tagged `mockHttpClientServiceInstance`.
    ```typescript
    // Old:
    // const MockHttpClient = Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClient as HttpClient);

    // New:
    const MockHttpClient = Layer.succeed(HttpClient, mockHttpClientServiceInstance);
    // No 'as HttpClient' cast should be needed now.
    ```

7.  **Review Type Compatibility:**
    Ensure that the method signatures within `mockHttpClientMethods` (parameters and return types of the `Effect`s) precisely match what `HttpClient.Default` expects. For example, most methods should return `Effect.Effect<HttpClientResponse.HttpClientResponse, HttpClientError.HttpClientError, never>`.

**Summary of Key Change:**
The main change is how the `mockHttpClient` instance (that is provided to `Layer.succeed(HttpClient, ...)`) is created. Instead of being a plain object, it must be created by calling `HttpClient.of(yourMockMethodsObject)`. This ensures the mock instance carries the necessary internal symbols (`[TypeId]`, etc.) that Effect-TS uses to identify services.

After applying these changes:
1.  Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false` (or your project's type-checking script).
2.  Verify that the `TS2352` error in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` regarding the `HttpClient` mock is resolved.
3.  Report any remaining TypeScript errors.
