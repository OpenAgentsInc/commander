# Fixing TS2352 Error in OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

## Problem Analysis

The TypeScript error `TS2352` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` indicates a type mismatch for `CreateChatCompletionResponse`. The specific issue is that the mock response objects used in the test file don't fully conform to the structure expected by the `@effect/ai-openai` library.

The key issue is a missing `refusal` property within the `choices[].message` structure of the mock responses, along with potentially other required fields from the `ChatCompletionResponseMessage` type.

## Implementation Plan

1. Locate all mock implementations that return `CreateChatCompletionResponse` objects
2. Update each mock to include all required fields, particularly adding the `refusal` property to `choices[].message`
3. Ensure other non-optional fields are present as per the type definition
4. Apply proper type casting to help TypeScript understand the structure

## Implementation

### Step 1: Add Missing Type Imports

First, I added the necessary type imports to ensure proper typing:

```typescript
import type {
  CreateChatCompletionRequest,
  CreateChatCompletionResponse,
  ChatCompletionResponseMessage,
  ChatCompletionMessageToolCalls,
  CompletionUsage,
  CreateEmbeddingRequest,
  CreateEmbeddingResponse,
  ListModelsResponse
} from "@effect/ai-openai/Generated";
```

### Step 2: Fix the First Mock Implementation

I identified the first mock implementation at the beginning of the file and updated it to include all required fields:

```typescript
// Mock the chat completions create to return test data
mockCreateChatCompletion.mockImplementation(() => {
  const mockResponseData = {
    id: "test-id",
    object: "chat.completion" as const,
    created: Date.now(),
    model: "gemma3:1b",
    choices: [
      {
        index: 0,
        message: {
          role: "assistant" as const,
          content: "Test response",
          refusal: null, // Required by ChatCompletionResponseMessage
          tool_calls: undefined,
          function_call: undefined,
          audio: undefined
        },
        finish_reason: "stop" as const,
        logprobs: null
      }
    ],
    usage: {
      prompt_tokens: 10,
      completion_tokens: 5,
      total_tokens: 15,
      completion_tokens_details: undefined,
      prompt_tokens_details: undefined,
    },
    system_fingerprint: undefined,
    service_tier: undefined,
  };
  // Explicitly cast to the library's response type
  return Effect.succeed(mockResponseData as typeof CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type);
});
```

### Step 3: Fix the Second Mock Implementation

I found another implementation in the `beforeEach` block and updated it similarly:

```typescript
// Mock successful response from Ollama
mockCreateChatCompletion.mockImplementation((params) => {
  // Return an Effect for non-streaming requests
  const mockResponseData = {
    id: "test-id",
    object: "chat.completion" as const,
    created: Date.now(),
    model: params.model,
    choices: [
      {
        index: 0,
        message: {
          role: "assistant" as const,
          content: "Test response",
          refusal: null, // Required by ChatCompletionResponseMessage
          tool_calls: undefined,
          function_call: undefined,
          audio: undefined
        },
        finish_reason: "stop" as const,
        logprobs: null
      }
    ],
    usage: {
      prompt_tokens: 10,
      completion_tokens: 5,
      total_tokens: 15,
      completion_tokens_details: undefined,
      prompt_tokens_details: undefined,
    },
    system_fingerprint: undefined,
    service_tier: undefined,
  };
  // Explicitly cast to the library's response type
  return Effect.succeed(mockResponseData as typeof CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type);
});
```

Key changes in both implementations:

1. Added `refusal: null` to the `message` object (required by `ChatCompletionResponseMessage`)
2. Added other optional fields as `undefined`
3. Used `as const` type assertions for literal types
4. Explicitly cast the entire object to `typeof CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type`

### Step 4: Verify Changes

After making these changes, I ran the TypeScript check:

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
```

The specific TS2352 errors related to `CreateChatCompletionResponse` and the missing `refusal` property have been resolved. There are still some TypeScript errors in the file, but they're related to project configuration, path aliases, and other issues not directly related to our current task.

## Conclusion

The fix involved:

1. Adding proper imports for all necessary types
2. Updating the mock response objects to include the required `refusal` property
3. Adding other optional fields with appropriate values
4. Using proper type casting to help TypeScript understand the structure

These changes ensure that the mock objects used in the test file now properly conform to the shape expected by the `@effect/ai-openai` library's `CreateChatCompletionResponse` type.
