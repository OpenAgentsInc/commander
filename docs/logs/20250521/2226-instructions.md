Okay, I will focus on the TypeScript error category **`TS2345: Argument of type '...' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Service' / 'HttpClient'` due to missing properties in mock objects** within the test file `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`.

This error indicates that the mock objects used for testing the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` service are not fully implementing the interfaces they are supposed to represent (`OpenAiClient.Service` and `HttpClient`), leading to type mismatches.

**Target File for Fixes:**

*   `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`

**Instructions for the Coding Agent:**

Your task is to modify the mock objects in `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` to correctly and completely implement the `OpenAiClient.Service` and `HttpClient` interfaces.

**Specific Error 1: Incompatible `Service` mock (for `OllamaOpenAIClientTag`)**

*   **Error Message Context:** `Argument of type '{ client: { chat: { completions: { create: Mock<Procedure>; }; }; embeddings: { create: Mock<() => Effect.Effect<never, never, never>>; }; models: { list: Mock<() => Effect.Effect<...>>; }; }; streamRequest: Mock<...>; stream: Mock<...>; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Service'. Types of property 'client' are incompatible. Type '{ chat: { completions: { create: Mock<Procedure>; }; }; embeddings: { create: Mock<() => Effect<never, never, never>>; }; models: { list: Mock<() => Effect<never, never, never>>; }; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Client': "listAssistants", "createAssistant", "getAssistant", "modifyAssistant", and 90 more.`
*   **Location in Test File:** Around the definition of `mockClientService` and its usage in `MockOllamaOpenAIClient`.
*   **Problem:** The `mockClientService.client` object does not match the structure of `Generated.Client` from `@effect/ai-openai/Generated`. The `Generated.Client` interface has a flat structure of methods (e.g., `createChatCompletion`, `createEmbedding`, `listModels`, `listAssistants`, etc.), not a nested one like `client.chat.completions.create`.

**Instructions to Fix Error 1:**

1.  **Import Necessary Types:** Ensure you have types for request and response objects from `@effect/ai-openai/Generated` if you intend to mock specific return values for the client methods.
    ```typescript
    // At the top of OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
    import type {
        // Example:
        CreateChatCompletionRequest,
        CreateChatCompletionResponse,
        CreateEmbeddingRequest,
        CreateEmbeddingResponse,
        ListModelsResponse
        // Add other request/response types as needed for stubs
    } from "@effect/ai-openai/Generated";
    ```

2.  **Restructure `mockClientService.client`:**
    Modify the `mockClientService` object. Its `client` property must be an object that directly implements all methods of the `Generated.Client` interface.

    *   **Current problematic structure in test:**
        ```typescript
        const mockClientService = {
          client: {
            chat: { completions: { create: mockChatCompletionsCreate } },
            embeddings: { create: vi.fn(...) },
            models: { list: vi.fn(...) },
          },
          streamRequest: ...,
          stream: ...,
        };
        ```

    *   **Corrected structure:**
        ```typescript
        // In OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

        const mockCreateChatCompletion = vi.fn(); // Already defined in the file
        const mockCreateEmbedding = vi.fn(() => Effect.die("mock embeddings.create not implemented"));
        const mockListModels = vi.fn(() => Effect.die("mock models.list not implemented"));
        // ... add vi.fn() mocks for other essential methods if you plan to call them in tests ...

        const mockGeneratedClient: Generated.Client = { // Explicitly type this for clarity
            createChatCompletion: mockCreateChatCompletion,
            createEmbedding: mockCreateEmbedding,
            listModels: mockListModels,
            // --- ADD STUBS FOR ALL OTHER METHODS FROM Generated.Client ---
            // You MUST add stubs for all methods defined in the Generated.Client interface.
            // Use vi.fn() returning Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: <methodName>") for each.
            // Example for a few, refer to node_modules/@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/Generated.d.ts for the full list:
            listAssistants: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: listAssistants")),
            createAssistant: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createAssistant")),
            getAssistant: vi.fn((_assistantId: string) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: getAssistant")),
            modifyAssistant: vi.fn((_assistantId: string, _options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: modifyAssistant")),
            deleteAssistant: vi.fn((_assistantId: string) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: deleteAssistant")),
            createSpeech: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createSpeech")),
            createTranscription: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createTranscription")),
            createTranslation: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createTranslation")),
            listFiles: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: listFiles")),
            createFile: vi.fn((_options: any) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: createFile")),
            retrieveFile: vi.fn((_fileId: string) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: retrieveFile")),
            deleteFile: vi.fn((_fileId: string) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: deleteFile")),
            downloadFile: vi.fn((_fileId: string) => Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: downloadFile")),
            // ... continue for all methods in Generated.Client (approx. 90 more)
            // It is crucial to list them all out to satisfy the interface.
            // For methods that take options, use `_options: any` for simplicity in stubs.
            // For methods that take specific IDs, use `_id: string`.
        };

        const mockClientService = { // This object matches OpenAiClient.Service
            client: mockGeneratedClient,
            streamRequest: vi.fn(() => Stream.die("mock streamRequest not implemented")),
            stream: mockStream, // mockStream is already defined in the file
        };
        ```
    *   **Action:** You must meticulously go through the `Generated.Client` interface in `node_modules/@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/Generated.d.ts` and add a `vi.fn()` stub for **every single method** listed there to the `mockGeneratedClient` object. The error message "and 90 more" implies a large number of missing methods.

**Specific Error 2: Incompatible `HttpClient` mock**

*   **Error Message Context:** `Argument of type '{ request: Mock<() => Effect.Effect<{ status: number; body: {}; }, never, never>>; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'HttpClient'. Type '{ request: Mock<() => Effect.Effect<{ status: number; body: {}; }, never, never>>; }' is missing the following properties from type 'With<HttpClientError, never>': execute, get, head, post, and 8 more.`
*   **Location in Test File:** Around the definition of `mockHttpClient`.
*   **Problem:** The `mockHttpClient` object only implements the `request` method, while the full `HttpClient` interface (from `@effect/platform/HttpClient`) requires several other methods like `execute`, `get`, `post`, etc.

**Instructions to Fix Error 2:**

1.  **Augment `mockHttpClient`:** Add the missing methods to the `mockHttpClient` object. For testing purposes, these can be simple `vi.fn()` stubs.

    *   **Current problematic structure:**
        ```typescript
        const mockHttpClient = {
          request: vi.fn(() => Effect.succeed({ status: 200, body: {} })),
        };
        ```

    *   **Corrected structure:**
        ```typescript
        // In OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
        import * as HttpClientRequest from "@effect/platform/HttpClientRequest"; // For request types
        import * as HttpClientResponse from "@effect/platform/HttpClientResponse"; // For response types

        const mockHttpClient = {
            request: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) => Effect.succeed(
                HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: {} }, req) // Return a valid HttpClientResponse
            )),
            // --- ADD STUBS FOR ALL OTHER HttpClient METHODS ---
            execute: vi.fn((req: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) => Effect.succeed(
                HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: "execute mock" }, req)
            )),
            get: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) => Effect.succeed(
                HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `get ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.get(url, options))
            )),
            post: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `post ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.post(url, options))
            )),
            put: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `put ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.put(url, options))
            )),
            patch: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `patch ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.patch(url, options))
            )),
            del: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.WithBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `delete ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.del(url, options))
            )),
            head: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `head ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.head(url, options))
            )),
            options: vi.fn((url: string | URL, options?: HttpClientRequest.Options.NoBody) => Effect.succeed(
                 HttpClientResponse.unsafeJson({ status: 200, body: `options ${url} mock` }, HttpClientRequest.options(url, options))
            )),
            // The `pipe` method for HttpClient is part of the Platform.HttpClient interface.
            // It allows chaining operations. For a simple mock, it can return `this`.
            pipe(): any { return this; },
            toJSON: vi.fn(() => ({ _tag: "MockHttpClient" })),
            // Add `preprocess` if it's part of the interface you are targeting
            // preprocess: null as any, // or vi.fn()
        };
        ```
    *   **Action:** Refer to the `HttpClient` interface definition in `@effect/platform/HttpClient` (likely `HttpClient.Default`) and add stubs for all its methods. The example above covers the common ones (`execute`, `get`, `post`, etc.). Pay attention to the `With<HttpClientError, never>` part of the error, which might indicate methods added by utility types; ensure your mock satisfies the final composed interface.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Stub Return Values:** The stubs should return `Effect` instances that are compatible with the expected return types of the original methods, even if they are just `Effect.die("Not implemented in mock: <methodName>")`. For `HttpClient` stubs, ensure they return something that looks like an `HttpClientResponse.HttpClientResponse` within an `Effect`.
*   **Thoroughness:** For the `Generated.Client` mock, it's critical to add stubs for *all* ~90 methods. This is tedious but necessary for type correctness. You might consider writing a small script to generate these stubs if doing it manually is too error-prone.

After implementing these changes, run `pnpm t` or `pnpm tsc --noEmit` to verify that the TypeScript errors are resolved. The goal is to make the mock objects complete enough to satisfy the TypeScript compiler.Okay, Agent, I will focus on fixing the **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')** in `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`.

This error typically occurs in Effect-TS when you are trying to use `.pipe()` on something that you expect to be an `Effect`, but it is actually `undefined`. This often happens when a service method that's supposed to return an `Effect` is not correctly mocked or when a dependency that the service relies on to construct its `Effect` is missing or incorrectly provided in the test environment.

**Target File for Fixes:**

*   `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`

**Understanding the Test Failures and Error Source:**

The stack traces in the "Test Results" section point to lines within `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` itself (e.g., lines 142, 122) during the execution of tests like:
*   `should successfully build the layer and provide AgentLanguageModel`
*   `should use default model name if config value is not found`
*   `should properly call generateText with correct parameters`
*   `should properly map errors from the client to AIProviderError`

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` suggests that within the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` layer's implementation, an `Effect` is expected from one of its dependencies (like `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` or `ConfigurationService`), but `undefined` is being received, and then `pipe` is called on this `undefined` value.

Looking at `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`, the `provider` object, which is derived from `OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)` and the `ollamaAdaptedClient`, has methods like `generateText`, `streamText`, etc. These methods are expected to return `Effect` or `Stream` instances.

The test setup for `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` is:
```typescript
// Mock the OpenAI client
const mockChatCompletionsCreate = vi.fn(); // This is for the *client's client*
const mockStream = vi.fn();                 // This is for the *client's stream* method

// Create a properly typed mock client that matches OpenAiClient.Service
const mockClientService = { // This object should be an OpenAiClient.Service implementation
  client: { // This is the Generated.Client part
    // ... (this part was addressed in previous instructions regarding flatness and completeness)
    createChatCompletion: mockChatCompletionsCreate, // Example if it's flat
    // ... other Generated.Client methods
  },
  streamRequest: vi.fn(() => Stream.die("mock streamRequest not implemented")),
  stream: mockStream, // This is the top-level stream method of OpenAiClient.Service
};

const MockOllamaOpenAIClient = Layer.succeed(
  OllamaOpenAIClientTag, // This Tag is for OpenAiClient.Service
  mockClientService,     // So, mockClientService MUST implement OpenAiClient.Service
);
// ...
// Mock ConfigurationService
const mockConfigGet = vi.fn();
const MockConfigurationService = Layer.succeed(ConfigurationService, {
  get: mockConfigGet,
  // ...
});
```

The `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` layer depends on:
1.  `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` (which is `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient`)
2.  `ConfigurationService`
3.  `TelemetryService`
4.  `HttpClient` (implicitly, because `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` which uses `OpenAiClient` which uses `HttpClient` for its actual network calls if not mocked further down).

The test provides `MockOllamaOpenAIClient`, `MockConfigurationService`, `MockTelemetryService`, and `MockHttpClient`.

The problem might be in how `OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName)` is interacting with the mocked `ollamaAdaptedClient` (which is `mockClientService`). If `OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)` internally tries to call methods on `ollamaAdaptedClient.client` that are not properly stubbed to return Effects, then when `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` tries to use the resulting `provider.generateText(...).pipe(...)`, the `provider.generateText(...)` part might be undefined.

**Instruction for the Coding Agent:**

The most likely cause of `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` inside `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` during tests is that the **`OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)` factory from `@effect/ai-openai` is not being correctly used or its result is not being properly provided with its dependencies in the test, OR the mock client (`mockClientService` or its `client` property) passed to it is incomplete or returns non-Effect values where Effects are expected by `OpenAiLanguageModel.model`.**

The `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file itself contains a *mock* for `OpenAiLanguageModel` for TypeScript compilation purposes:
```typescript
// Mock implementation for OpenAiLanguageModel since the package structure might be different
// This matches what was done in OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.ts
const OpenAiLanguageModel = {
  model: (modelName: string) =>
    Effect.gen(function* (_) { // This should return Effect<Provider<AiLanguageModel>, ConfigError, ActualClientDependency>
      // This model function returns an Effect of a language model provider
      return { // This is the Provider<AiLanguageModel>
        generateText: (params: any): Effect.Effect<AiResponse, unknown> => { /* ... */ },
        streamText: (params: any): Stream.Stream<AiTextChunk, unknown> => /* ... */,
        generateStructured: (params: any): Effect.Effect<AiResponse, unknown> =>  /* ... */,
      };
    }),
};
```
This mock is inside `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` itself. If this mock is being used by the test file instead of the actual `@effect/ai-openai` library's `OpenAiLanguageModel`, then this mock needs to be perfect.

**The key issue is that the mock `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` returns an object directly, not an `Effect` that resolves to that object.** The actual `@effect/ai-openai` `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` returns an `Effect<AiModel<AiLanguageModel, OpenAiClient>, ConfigError, OpenAiClient>`.
Then, this `AiModel` (which is an `Effect` itself) needs to be run to get the `Provider<AiLanguageModel>`.

**Refined Instructions for `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` (the SUT, not the test file for now):**

1.  **Open `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`.**
2.  **Modify the Mock `OpenAiLanguageModel` (if it's truly a local mock and not intended to be from the library):**
    The local mock for `OpenAiLanguageModel` within `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` must be updated. The `model` function should return an `Effect` which, when run, yields the provider object.

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts

    // ... other imports ...
    import { OpenAiLanguageModel as RealOpenAiLanguageModel } from "@effect/ai-openai"; // Import the real one for use

    // Remove or comment out the local mock OpenAiLanguageModel:
    /*
    const OpenAiLanguageModel = {
      model: (modelName: string) =>
        Effect.gen(function* (_) { // THIS IS THE PROBLEM - it's returning the provider directly, not an Effect<Provider>
          return { ... };
        }),
    };
    */

    export const OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive = Layer.effect(
      AgentLanguageModel,
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        const ollamaAdaptedClient = yield* _(OllamaOpenAIClientTag);
        const configService = yield* _(ConfigurationService);
        const telemetry = yield* _(TelemetryService);
        // ... modelNameEffect logic ...
        const modelName = yield* _(modelNameEffect);

        // Use the REAL OpenAiLanguageModel.model from the library
        const aiModelEffectDefinition = RealOpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName); // This returns Effect<AiModel<...>, ..., OpenAiClient>

        // Provide the ollamaAdaptedClient (which implements OpenAiClient.Service)
        // to the AiModel definition effect.
        const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
          aiModelEffectDefinition,
          OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, // The Tag for the service being provided
          ollamaAdaptedClient         // The actual service instance
        );

        // Yielding this effect gives us the AiModel<AgentLanguageModel, never>
        const aiModel = yield* _(configuredAiModelEffect);

        // An AiModel is an Effect that resolves to a Provider. So, run the AiModel effect.
        const provider = yield* _(aiModel); // This runs the AiModel effect and yields Provider<AgentLanguageModel>

        // ... rest of the implementation remains the same, using `provider.generateText` etc.
        // Ensure the methods on `provider` are correctly returning Effects/Streams.
        // The methods on the object returned by the mock `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`
        // (which `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` resolves to in the test) also need to return Effects.

        return AgentLanguageModel.of({
          _tag: "AgentLanguageModel",
          generateText: (params: GenerateTextOptions) =>
            provider.generateText(params).pipe( /* error mapping */ ),
          streamText: (params: StreamTextOptions) =>
            provider.streamText(params).pipe( /* error mapping */ ),
          generateStructured: (params: GenerateStructuredOptions) =>
            provider.generateStructured(params).pipe( /* error mapping */ ),
        });
      }),
    );
    ```

**Now, address the Test File `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`:**

The test file is mocking `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` which is `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient`. This tag is a dependency for `RealOpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)`. The methods on the *mocked client* (`mockClientService.client.createChatCompletion`, etc.) must return `Effect` instances that the `RealOpenAiLanguageModel` expects.

1.  **Open `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`**
2.  **Ensure Mocks for `mockClientService.client` methods return Effects:**
    The `mockChatCompletionsCreate` (which is used for `client.createChatCompletion` in the flat structure if you've fixed that) must return an `Effect`. Your current mock *does* return an `Effect`:
    ```typescript
    mockChatCompletionsCreate.mockImplementation((params) => {
      // ...
      return Effect.succeed({ /* ... response ... */ });
    });
    ```
    This part seems okay. The issue is more likely the structure of `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` call inside the SUT (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`) or if the test is somehow bypassing the actual library and using an incomplete local mock.

    **The key is to ensure the SUT (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`) uses the *actual* `OpenAiLanguageModel.model` from `@effect/ai-openai` and correctly handles its two-step resolution (`Effect<AiModel>` then `Effect<Provider>`).**

3.  **Modify Test `program` for clarity on how service is resolved:**
    In your tests, when you do `yield* _(AgentLanguageModel)`, it resolves through `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive`. This layer's `Effect.gen` block is what runs.
    If the `pipe` error occurs within `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` (e.g., at `provider.generateText(params).pipe(...)`), it means `provider.generateText(params)` was undefined. This implies that `provider` itself, or its `generateText` method, was not correctly formed.

    The `provider` comes from:
    ```typescript
    const aiModelEffectDefinition = RealOpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName);
    const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(aiModelEffectDefinition, OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, ollamaAdaptedClient);
    const aiModel = yield* _(configuredAiModelEffect); // AiModel<AgentLanguageModel, never>
    const provider = yield* _(aiModel); // Provider<AgentLanguageModel>
    ```
    If `ollamaAdaptedClient` (which is `mockClientService` in the test) doesn't correctly implement `OpenAiClient.Service` with methods that return `Effect`s that `RealOpenAiLanguageModel.model` can work with, then `aiModel` or `provider` could be malformed.

    **Given your previous fixes to `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` to make its `client` methods return `Effect<..., HttpClientError | ParseError>`, and assuming the `OpenAiClient.Service` interface for `stream` and `streamRequest` methods in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` also correctly return `Stream<..., HttpClientError>`, the `ollamaAdaptedClient` mock in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` must align with this.**

    Your `mockClientService` for `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` in the test file:
    ```typescript
    const mockClientService = {
      client: { /* all Generated.Client methods as stubs returning Effects */
        createChatCompletion: mockChatCompletionsCreate, // This returns Effect.succeed(...)
        // ... other stubs ...
      },
      streamRequest: vi.fn(() => Stream.die("mock streamRequest not implemented")), // This should be Effect or Stream based on actual interface
      stream: mockStream, // This returns Stream.fromIterable(...) - Ensure it's correct
    };
    ```
    The `streamRequest` from `@effect/ai-openai/OpenAiClient.d.ts` is:
    `readonly streamRequest: <A>(request: HttpClientRequest.HttpClientRequest) => Stream.Stream<A, HttpClientError.HttpClientError>;`
    Your mock correctly returns a `Stream`.

    The `stream` method from `@effect/ai-openai/OpenAiClient.d.ts` is:
    `readonly stream: (request: StreamCompletionRequest) => Stream.Stream<StreamChunk, HttpClientError.HttpClientError>;`
    Your `mockStream` is defined as:
    ```typescript
    mockStream.mockImplementation(() =>
      Stream.fromIterable([ { /* ... StreamChunk like object ... */ } ])
    );
    ```
    This also seems correct.

**Final Check & Primary Action for Agent:**

The most probable remaining cause is that the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file *itself* might still have its own local, incomplete mock of `OpenAiLanguageModel` that it's using instead of the real one from `@effect/ai-openai`.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Open `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`.**
2.  **Locate the `OpenAiLanguageModel` import.** Ensure it's importing from `@effect/ai-openai`:
    ```typescript
    import { OpenAiClient, OpenAiLanguageModel } from "@effect/ai-openai";
    ```
3.  **Remove any local mock definition of `OpenAiLanguageModel`** within `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`. The previous mock definition like this:
    ```typescript
    // const OpenAiLanguageModel = { model: (modelName: string) => Effect.succeed({ generateText: ..., streamText: ..., generateStructured: ... }) }; // THIS IS LIKELY THE PROBLEM
    ```
    **MUST be removed or commented out.**
4.  **Ensure the two-step resolution of `AiModel` then `Provider` is used inside `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts Effect.gen block:
    const aiModelEffectDefinition = OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName); // From @effect/ai-openai

    const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
      aiModelEffectDefinition,
      OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient,
      ollamaAdaptedClient
    );
    const aiModel = yield* _(configuredAiModelEffect); // Step 1: Resolve AiModel
    const provider = yield* _(aiModel); // Step 2: Resolve Provider from AiModel
    ```

By ensuring `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` uses the actual `OpenAiLanguageModel` from the library and correctly resolves the `Provider`, the `provider.generateText(...).pipe(...)` calls should then work with an actual `Effect` instance, resolving the `TypeError`.

After making these changes specifically in `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`, please run `pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false` and report the output. Then run `pnpm test src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` and report the test results.
