Okay, Agent, the TypeScript errors are resolved. Now, let's focus on the 4 failing tests in `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`. The consistent error is `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')`.

This error means that a variable expected to be an `Effect` or a `Stream` (on which `.pipe()` is called) is actually `undefined` at runtime within the SUT (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`).

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The SUT (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`) uses `OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName)` from `@effect/ai-openai`. This function returns an `Effect` that, when its `OpenAiClient.Service` dependency is provided, yields an `AiModel`. This `AiModel` is *also* an `Effect` that resolves to a `Provider<Service>`. The `Provider` should have methods like `generateText`, `streamText`, etc., which are themselves `Effect`s or `Stream`s.

The `TypeError` occurs when the SUT tries to call `.pipe()` on one of these provider methods (e.g., `provider.generateText(params).pipe(...)`), indicating that `provider.generateText(params)` (or the method itself) is `undefined`.

This can happen if:
1.  The `AiModel` or `Provider` resolution in the SUT is incorrect.
2.  The mocked `OpenAiClient.Service` (provided as `ollamaAdaptedClient` to `OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model` in the SUT during tests) is incomplete or its methods do not return what the `@effect/ai-openai` library expects, leading to a malformed `Provider`.

The agent's previous log (`2322-log.md`) confirmed that the SUT's two-step `yield*` resolution was corrected to:
```typescript
// Inside OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts
const aiModel_from_effect: AiModel<EffectAiLanguageModel, OpenAiClient.Service> = yield* _(configuredAiModelEffect);
const provider: Provider<EffectAiLanguageModel> = yield* _(aiModel_from_effect);
```
This is the correct pattern for resolving the `Provider`.

Therefore, the issue most likely lies in the **mocks provided by the test file** (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`) for the `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` dependency. The `OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model` function consumes this client. If the client's mocked methods (`client.createChatCompletion` or `stream`) don't return `Effect`s/`Stream`s with the precise structure (including error types) expected by the library, the `Provider` it builds might be faulty.

**Refined Instructions for the Coding Agent:**

**Objective:** Fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` in `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` by ensuring the test mocks for `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` are fully compatible with the expectations of `@effect/ai-openai`'s `OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model`.

**File to Modify:** `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`

1.  **Strengthen Mocks for `mockClientService` methods:**
    The methods on `mockClientService.client` (e.g., `createChatCompletion`) and `mockClientService.stream` must return `Effect`s and `Stream`s that precisely match the error channel types expected by `@effect/ai-openai`. The library expects `HttpClientError.HttpClientError | ParseError` for client methods and `HttpClientError.HttpClientError` for the `stream` method.

    *   **For `mockCreateChatCompletion` (used by `client.createChatCompletion`):**
        ```typescript
        // In OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts

        // When mocking a successful response:
        mockCreateChatCompletion.mockImplementation((params: typeof CreateChatCompletionRequest.Encoded) => {
          const mockResponseData = { /* ... your valid mock CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type data ... */ };
          // Ensure the success channel is correctly typed, and error channel matches expected.
          return Effect.succeed(mockResponseData as typeof CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type) as Effect.Effect<
            typeof CreateChatCompletionResponse.Type,
            HttpClientError.HttpClientError | ParseError // Explicitly type the error channel
          >;
        });

        // When mocking an error response (for the error mapping test):
        mockCreateChatCompletion.mockImplementation(() => {
          const request = HttpClientRequest.post("test-model-error");
          const webResponse = new Response("Mocked Client Error", { status: 500 });
          return Effect.fail( // Fail with the expected HttpClientError type
            new HttpClientError.ResponseError({
              request,
              response: HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(request, webResponse),
              reason: "StatusCode",
              description: "Simulated client error for testing error mapping in SUT",
            })
          );
        });
        ```

    *   **For `mockStream` (used by `mockClientService.stream`):**
        ```typescript
        import { StreamChunk } from "@effect/ai-openai/OpenAiClient"; // Ensure class is imported

        mockStream.mockImplementation((params: StreamCompletionRequest) => {
          // Ensure chunks are instances of StreamChunk
          const chunks: StreamChunk[] = [
            new StreamChunk({ parts: [{ _tag: "Content", content: "Stream chunk 1 " }] }),
            new StreamChunk({ parts: [{ _tag: "Content", content: `for ${params.model}` }] })
          ];
          // Ensure the stream has the correct error channel type
          return Stream.fromIterable(chunks) as Stream.Stream<
            StreamChunk,
            HttpClientError.HttpClientError // Explicitly type error channel
          >;
        });
        ```
    *   **For other stubbed methods in `mockClientService.client` (the `Generated.Client` part):**
        Ensure they also return `Effect.die(...)` or `Effect.fail(new HttpClientError...(...))` if a specific error type is needed for a test. `Effect.die` is generally fine for stubs not actively tested.

2.  **Verify `TestOllamaClientLayer` and `testLayerForOllamaAgentLM`:**
    Ensure the `MockHttpClient` is indeed part of `testLayerForOllamaAgentLM`. The previous agent log (`2259-instructions.md`) confirmed this structure was in place, which is correct.
    ```typescript
    // In OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts
    const testLayerForOllamaAgentLM = OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.pipe(
        Layer.provide(
            Layer.mergeAll(
                MockOllamaOpenAIClient,     // Provides OllamaOpenAIClientTag (OpenAiClient.Service)
                MockConfigurationService,   // Provides ConfigurationService
                MockTelemetryService,       // Provides TelemetryService
                MockHttpClient              // Provides HttpClient.HttpClient
            )
        )
    );
    ```

3.  **Ensure SUT (`OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`) uses the REAL library:**
    Double-check that `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` **does not** have a local mock for `OpenAiLanguageModel` and is correctly importing `OpenAiCompletions` from `@effect/ai-openai` and using `OpenAiCompletions.OpenAiLanguageModel.model`. The agent log `2322-log.md` indicated a fix for this.

**After applying these changes to `src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`:**

1.  Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit --pretty false`. Report output.
2.  Run `pnpm test src/tests/unit/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts`. Report output.

The `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pipe')` should now be resolved because the `provider` obtained in the SUT will be correctly formed by the `@effect/ai-openai` library, thanks to the more accurately mocked dependencies.

If the `AIProviderError` assertion test still fails, it would indicate an issue in the SUT's `Effect.mapError` logic or the way `AIProviderError` itself is constructed, but the `TypeError` should be gone.

The `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.test.ts` failure (`_op` error) will be addressed if it persists after these changes.
