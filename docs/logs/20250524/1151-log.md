# Implementation Log: Fast Response NIP-90 Payment Flow
## May 24, 2025 - 11:51

## Overview
Implementing the two-part fix from 1143-instructions.md:
1. Fix SparkService payment detection 
2. Add optimistic processing for fast user responses

## Implementation Progress

### Starting Implementation
- Reading 1143-instructions.md for exact changes needed
- Will prioritize SparkService fix first as it's likely the root cause
- Then add optimistic processing for guaranteed fast responses

## Progress

### ✅ Found checkInvoiceStatus method (line 910)
- Located in `/src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts`
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The method is currently using SDK MOCK logic!
- Lines 935-956 show it's returning hardcoded responses based on string matching
- Real SDK call is commented out with "// SDK MOCK"

### Issue Found: Mock Implementation
The current implementation (lines 942-956) only returns "PAID" if invoice contains "paid_invoice_stub" string, otherwise always returns "PENDING". This explains why payments never get detected!

### ✅ Fixed SparkService.checkInvoiceStatus() 
**Major fix completed** - replaced mock logic with real SDK implementation:

1. **Real SDK calls**: Now tries multiple methods (getInvoice, listInvoices, lookupInvoice)
2. **Comprehensive payment detection**: Checks 12+ different fields that indicate payment
3. **Extensive logging**: Full SDK response logged for debugging
4. **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation if SDK methods fail

**Key payment detection fields added:**
- `paymentPreimage` (most reliable indicator)
- `settled`, `settledAt`, `state: "SETTLED"`
- `isPaid`, `paid`, `confirmed` boolean flags
- `amountPaidMsat > 0` (amount received)
- Multiple status field variants

This should fix the core issue! Now adding optimistic processing for guaranteed fast responses.
