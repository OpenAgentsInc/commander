# Implementation Log: Enhanced DVM Payment Polling
## May 24, 2025 - Making DVM Payment Detection More Resilient

## Overview
Implementing improved payment polling strategy for Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts to address Lightning Network propagation delays. The goal is to poll more frequently, implement exponential backoff per job, and extend timeout windows to 10 minutes.

## Implementation Progress

### Starting Implementation
- Target file: `src/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts`
- Goal: Replace basic 60-second polling with sophisticated per-job backoff system
- Priority: Show fast responses to users by being more aggressive about payment detection

## Implementation Status
✅ Read and analyzed current Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts structure
✅ Duration and Schedule already imported (lines 7-8)

Current polling: 60-second intervals with basic retry
Target: 1-second overall checks with per-job exponential backoff

## Current Implementation Analysis
- `PendingJob` interface at lines 257-264 (missing polling fields)
- `checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatuses` at lines 544-791 (basic logic)
- `invoiceCheckFiber` scheduled at line 1538 (60-second interval)
- `processPaidJob` at lines 1253-1410 (missing cleanup at end)

## Implementation Progress
✅ Added enhanced polling constants (lines 53-58)
✅ Updated PendingJob interface with polling fields (lines 267, 272-273)

Key changes:
- Global check every 1 second (OVERALL_PENDING_JOBS_CHECK_INTERVAL_S = 1)
- Per-job exponential backoff starting at 5s (JOB_POLL_INITIAL_DELAY_MS = 5000)
- Max per-job delay of 60s (JOB_POLL_MAX_DELAY_MS = 60000)
- 10-minute total timeout (JOB_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_MS = 600000)

## Implementation Completed Successfully ✅

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Polling Constants** (lines 53-58)
   - Global check every 1 second (OVERALL_PENDING_JOBS_CHECK_INTERVAL_S = 1)
   - Per-job exponential backoff starting at 5s (JOB_POLL_INITIAL_DELAY_MS = 5000)
   - Max per-job delay of 60s (JOB_POLL_MAX_DELAY_MS = 60000)
   - 10-minute total timeout (JOB_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_MS = 600000)

2. **Updated PendingJob Interface** (lines 264-274)
   - Added paymentHash: string for proper invoice tracking
   - Added lastPolledAt: number for backoff timing
   - Added pollAttempts: number for exponential backoff calculation

3. **Enhanced processJobRequestInternal** (lines 1204-1218)
   - Extracts and stores paymentHash from invoice result
   - Initializes lastPolledAt to 0 for immediate first check
   - Initializes pollAttempts to 0

4. **New checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatusesLogic** (lines 554-708)
   - Implements per-job exponential backoff algorithm
   - Comprehensive timeout handling (10-minute job timeout)
   - Enhanced error handling with retries
   - Detailed telemetry tracking for each polling attempt

5. **Updated Invoice Check Fiber** (lines 1582-1604)
   - Uses new 1-second interval instead of 60 seconds
   - Calls enhanced logic with proper error handling

6. **Enhanced processPaidJob Cleanup** (lines 1456-1464)
   - Ensures jobs are removed from pendingJobs map after processing
   - Adds telemetry tracking for job lifecycle management

## Expected Impact:
- **Much faster payment detection**: 1s checks vs 60s
- **Efficient resource usage**: Per-job backoff prevents hammering
- **Better user experience**: Quick responses for successful payments
- **Resilient to Lightning delays**: 10-minute timeout with graceful degradation
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Network failures won't crash the system

## Next: Test the Implementation
