# WebGL Context Fix Implementation Log

## Understanding the Issue
- The main issue is "THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost" error when toggling hand tracking
- The problem is caused by unmounting/remounting the R3F `<Canvas>` component when toggling hand tracking
- This leads to WebGL context conflicts, especially if MediaPipe is also using WebGL resources

## Implementation Plan
1. Make the R3F canvas persistent by moving it to HomePage.tsx and always mounting it
2. Create a separate HandTrackingUIControls component for UI elements only
3. Ensure proper cleanup of MediaPipe resources in useHandTracking
4. Add diagnostic logging for context events

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Created HandTrackingUIControls.tsx
- Created a new component that handles only UI controls, video and canvas elements
- It doesn't include or render the ThreeScene component
- It receives all necessary props from HomePage including:
  - showHandTracking and setShowHandTracking
  - videoRef and landmarkCanvasRef
  - handTrackingStatus, activeHandPose, pinchMidpoint

### Step 2: Extracted MainSceneContent from ThreeScene
- Created MainSceneContent.tsx with just the scene content (no Canvas wrapper)
- This component accepts handPosition and renders the 3D interactive elements
- It will be used inside the persistent Canvas in HomePage

### Step 3: Enhanced useHandTracking cleanup
- Added a robust cleanupMediaPipe function that:
  - Stops camera and explicitly nullifies the reference
  - Closes MediaPipe Hands instance and nullifies the reference
  - Stops all video tracks and resets the video element
  - Clears the landmark canvas
  - Resets all state variables
- Added proper error handling for graceful shutdown
- Added more logging for better debugging

### Step 4: Modified HomePage.tsx
- Added persistent R3F Canvas that's always mounted (not conditional)
- Added WebGL context event listeners to catch and log context loss
- Used R3F's onCreated callback to add more context listeners
- Set good WebGL context parameters (powerPreference, etc.)
- Moved useHandTracking hook call to HomePage level
- Replaced HandTracking with HandTrackingUIControls component

### Step 5: Updated exports in index.ts
- Added export for new HandTrackingUIControls component
- Added export for MainSceneContent
- Kept original exports for backward compatibility

## Additional Fixes

After initial implementation, there was still a WebGL context loss issue when loading the app. Through progressive debugging, we've identified and fixed multiple issues:

### 1. Simplified MainSceneContent.tsx (First Attempt)
- Removed Physics and RigidBody components from @react-three/rapier
- Replaced with simple static mesh elements in a rotating group
- Simplified hand position visualization with a sphere
- Added useFrame for continuous animation without physics

### 2. Improved Canvas Configuration in HomePage.tsx
- Changed frameloop from "demand" to "always" for more stable rendering
- Set fixed DPR instead of a range for more consistent performance
- Turned off alpha channel (set to false) for better performance
- Added preserveDrawingBuffer to help with context persistence
- Used more balanced powerPreference setting
- Explicitly set clear color and called gl.clear() in onCreated
- Adjusted camera settings for better view

### 3. Further Simplified MainSceneContent.tsx (Second Attempt)
- Removed Environment component completely - this was causing `"Could not load /px.png,/nx.png,/py.png,/ny.png,/pz.png,/nz.png"` errors
- Replaced meshStandardMaterial with meshBasicMaterial to eliminate need for lighting/environment maps
- Set scene background color directly in useEffect instead of using <color> component
- Reduced complexity of the scene to absolute minimum to ensure stability
- Removed shadows and other advanced rendering features

### 4. Fixed Infinite Update Loop in PinnableChatWindow
- Added throttling to prevent too many updates during pinch dragging
- Only updating position when significant movement is detected (> 3px delta)
- Updated pinch reference points during drag to avoid accumulating small movements
- Reset refs properly to prevent React state update loops

### 5. Fixed UI Issues Based on User Feedback
- Restricted pinch dragging to only work when pinching directly on the chat window
- Removed the large pink sphere that was following the hand position
- Changed random box positions to a stable, predictable grid pattern
- Made rotation gentler and only on Y axis to avoid chaotic movement
- Removed debugging output that was causing confusion

### 6. Enhanced 3D Scene and Hand Interaction
- Added hand gesture-based rotation control: 
  - FLAT_HAND rotates clockwise at normal speed
  - OPEN_HAND rotates counter-clockwise at normal speed
  - Other poses rotate in the last direction but much slower
- Implemented proper lighting with directional and point lights
- Added shadow casting for more visual depth
- Removed the pinch coordinate display from the top-left corner

### 7. Implemented Glowing White Cubes with Enhanced Visuals
- Made all cubes shiny white with very high emissive properties
- Made rotation 5x faster when flat/open hand detected (0.5 vs 0.1)
- Added bloom post-processing effect from @react-three/postprocessing
- Created dramatic contrast with optimized bloom settings:
  - Moderate intensity (0.8) for better contrast
  - Higher luminance threshold (0.3) to increase darkness in non-glowing areas
  - Smooth edges with luminance smoothing (0.9)
  - Mipmap blur for better performance
- Completely overhauled lighting system:
  - Base color set to pure black (#000000) with bright white emissive overlay
  - Optimized emissive intensity to 0.7 for better contrast 
  - Ultra-low roughness (0.02) for sharp, defined highlights
  - Extremely high metalness (0.98) for mirror-like reflections
  - Fine-tuned envMapIntensity of 1.5 for balanced reflections
  - Significantly reduced ambient light (0.1) to increase darkness and contrast
  - Reduced directional and point light intensities for more dramatic shadows
  - Added multiple point lights at different positions for selective highlights

### 8. Fixed Two-Hand Detection
- Changed maxNumHands setting back to 2 in the MediaPipe Hands configuration
- The system now properly detects and tracks two hands simultaneously
- This allows for more complex interactions using both hands

## Result
With these changes, the WebGL context should remain stable. We've eliminated both the @react-three/rapier dependency and the Environment component from drei, both of which were causing context issues. The 3D scene is now enhanced but stable, showing a neatly arranged grid of glowing white cubes with proper lighting, shadows, and bloom effects.

The scene now responds to hand gestures:
- FLAT_HAND will cause the cubes to rotate clockwise at high speed (0.5)
- OPEN_HAND will cause the cubes to rotate counter-clockwise at high speed (0.5)
- All other poses maintain the last rotation direction but at a much slower speed (0.01)

Visual improvements include:
- Ultra-bright glowing white cubes with high emissive intensity
- Much higher bloom effect that creates a dazzling glow around cubes
- Multiple point lights creating dynamic highlights and reflections
- High-quality shadows with improved resolution and bias correction
- A steady, predictable grid layout with proper perspective depth

The chat window interaction has been significantly improved:
1. It can now be dragged with either mouse or hand pinch gestures, even when hand tracking is active
2. The pinch dragging only activates when the user pinches directly on the chat window element
3. The distracting "PINCHING" text overlay has been removed for a cleaner interface
4. It prevents infinite update loops by only applying position updates when significant movement is detected
5. It properly updates reference points during the drag operation to provide smooth movement
6. The pinch coordinate display has been removed from the UI for a cleaner interface

The MediaPipe resources are properly managed and cleaned up when not in use, and the WebGL context should no longer be lost when toggling hand tracking.
