# WebGL Context Fix Implementation Log

## Understanding the Issue
- The main issue is "THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost" error when toggling hand tracking
- The problem is caused by unmounting/remounting the R3F `<Canvas>` component when toggling hand tracking
- This leads to WebGL context conflicts, especially if MediaPipe is also using WebGL resources

## Implementation Plan
1. Make the R3F canvas persistent by moving it to HomePage.tsx and always mounting it
2. Create a separate HandTrackingUIControls component for UI elements only
3. Ensure proper cleanup of MediaPipe resources in useHandTracking
4. Add diagnostic logging for context events

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Created HandTrackingUIControls.tsx
- Created a new component that handles only UI controls, video and canvas elements
- It doesn't include or render the ThreeScene component
- It receives all necessary props from HomePage including:
  - showHandTracking and setShowHandTracking
  - videoRef and landmarkCanvasRef
  - handTrackingStatus, activeHandPose, pinchMidpoint

### Step 2: Extracted MainSceneContent from ThreeScene
- Created MainSceneContent.tsx with just the scene content (no Canvas wrapper)
- This component accepts handPosition and renders the 3D interactive elements
- It will be used inside the persistent Canvas in HomePage

### Step 3: Enhanced useHandTracking cleanup
- Added a robust cleanupMediaPipe function that:
  - Stops camera and explicitly nullifies the reference
  - Closes MediaPipe Hands instance and nullifies the reference
  - Stops all video tracks and resets the video element
  - Clears the landmark canvas
  - Resets all state variables
- Added proper error handling for graceful shutdown
- Added more logging for better debugging

### Step 4: Modified HomePage.tsx
- Added persistent R3F Canvas that's always mounted (not conditional)
- Added WebGL context event listeners to catch and log context loss
- Used R3F's onCreated callback to add more context listeners
- Set good WebGL context parameters (powerPreference, etc.)
- Moved useHandTracking hook call to HomePage level
- Replaced HandTracking with HandTrackingUIControls component

### Step 5: Updated exports in index.ts
- Added export for new HandTrackingUIControls component
- Added export for MainSceneContent
- Kept original exports for backward compatibility

## Result
With these changes, the R3F Canvas is now persistent and doesn't get unmounted when hand tracking is toggled. The MediaPipe resources are properly managed and cleaned up when not in use. The WebGL context loss issue should be resolved, and we have improved logging to diagnose any remaining issues.
