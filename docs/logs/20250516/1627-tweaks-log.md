# 1627-tweaks Log

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Pinch Threshold

Raised the pinch threshold in `handPoseRecognition.ts` from 0.08 to 0.1 as requested. This will make the application slightly less sensitive to pinch gestures, requiring the thumb and index finger to be closer together for the pinch to register.

```diff
- const pinchThreshold = 0.08; // Decreased from 0.15 to require fingers to be closer together
+ const pinchThreshold = 0.1; // Increased from 0.08 to 0.1 as requested
```

### 2. Removed Console Logs

Cleaned up console logs from `useHandTracking.ts`:
- Removed unnecessary comment lines about console logging
- Removed debug comments about MediaPipe initialization steps
- Replaced console.warn with a comment for unavailable refs
- Simplified verbose comments in cleanup function

These changes should help reduce console output and keep the browser console cleaner during operation.

## Result

The changes are complete. The pinch threshold has been slightly increased which should make pinch gestures more deliberate with fewer accidental activations. The console output has been further reduced by removing commented-out logging code and simplifying verbose comments.
