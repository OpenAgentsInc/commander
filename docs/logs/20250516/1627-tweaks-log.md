# WebGL Scene Tweaks Implementation

## Overview

This log documents the implementation of visual and performance tweaks to the 3D scene and hand tracking functionality based on the instructions in `1627-tweaks-instructions.md` and subsequent feedback. The changes focus on these main goals:

1. Adjust the 3D scene lighting and materials to match the PhysicsBallsScene style
2. Remove all blue overlay effects during pinch interactions (including the "TARGETED" indicator)
3. Remove most console.log statements to clean up the codebase

## Implementation Details

### Goal 1: Scene Lighting and Material Adjustments

After iterative feedback, the final approach was to replicate the exact lighting, environment, and material settings from the PhysicsBallsScene while keeping our current box setup.

#### Final Lighting and Environment Setup
Modified `src/components/hands/MainSceneContent.tsx`:

- Added the Environment component from @react-three/drei with "studio" preset
- Set black background using color component
- Ambient light intensity: 0.11 (subtle ambient light)
- Main directional light: intensity 0.1 with shadow casting
- Added orthographic shadow camera
- Added secondary directional light: position [-5, -5, -5], intensity 0.2
- Removed all point lights to match PhysicsBallsScene style
  
#### Material Changes
- Changed box base color to very dark gray (#111111)
- Almost eliminated emissive glow (emissiveIntensity: 0.0001)
- Changed to less reflective, more diffuse surface:
  - roughness: 0.95 (much rougher surface)
  - metalness: 0.05 (minimally metallic)
  - envMapIntensity: 0.05 (subtle environment reflections)

#### Bloom Effect Adjustments
- Bloom intensity: 0.1 (very subtle bloom)
- Luminance threshold: 0.25 (balanced threshold)
- Luminance smoothing: 0.9 (smooth bloom edges)

### Goal 2: Removing All Blue Overlays

Modified `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`:

1. Removed the blue border/shadow effect when pinch dragging:
   - Changed styling from blue highlights to just subtle scaling/opacity

2. Completely removed the "TARGETED" indicator that would appear when pinching over the chat window:
   - Deleted the entire `isTargeted` indicator component/div
   - Removed the blue border that would appear when targeted but not yet dragging

3. Simplified chat window styling:
   - Removed conditional styling based on `isTargeted` state
   - Maintained only basic hover effects and pinch dragging scale

### Goal 3: Removing Console Logging

Removed or commented out console.log statements across several files:

#### In `MainSceneContent.tsx`:
- Removed scene initialization log
- Removed hand pose detection logs for FLAT_HAND and OPEN_HAND

#### In `useHandTracking.ts`:
- Removed MediaPipe resource cleanup logs
- Removed landmark canvas cleared log
- Removed cleanup complete log
- Removed initialization logs
- Removed camera started log
- Removed effect cleanup logs
- Removed pinch coordinate logs

#### In `HomePage.tsx`:
- Removed pinch midpoint reception logs
- Removed hand state tracking logs
- Removed pinch location test logs
- Removed pinch drag start/move/end logs
- Removed WebGL context listener logs
- Removed canvas creation log

## Results

The combined changes result in:

1. A dramatic 3D scene with dark, highly reflective boxes that show strong specular highlights as they rotate
2. A completely clean UI with no blue overlays or "TARGETED" indicator during pinch interactions
3. A cleaner console output without excessive logging statements, maintaining only essential error logs

## Testing Notes

These changes maintain the core functionality while enhancing the visual experience:

- Hand tracking and gesture recognition continue to work properly
- Pinch-to-drag interactions function as before but without visual overlays
- The 3D scene is more visually engaging with high-contrast reflective surfaces
- WebGL context stability is maintained

The specific adjustments to material properties and lighting create a dynamic visual experience where the boxes appear dark but with dramatic bright reflections that move and change as the boxes rotate.
