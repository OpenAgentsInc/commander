## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration & Backend Abstractions ✅
- Created implementation log ✅
- Reviewed requirements and architecture ✅
- Identified implementation phases and dependencies ✅
- Created NIP90ProviderConfigSchema ✅
- Set up provider configuration in ConfigurationServiceImpl ✅
- Created NIP90ProviderConfigTag ✅

### Phase 2: NIP-90 Chat Provider Implementation ✅
- Created NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive implementation ✅
  - Implemented generateText with NIP-90 job requests
  - Added streaming support via subscribeToJobUpdates
  - Added comprehensive error handling and telemetry
  - Added support for ephemeral keys and encryption
- Added unit tests for NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive ✅
  - Test coverage for text generation
  - Test coverage for streaming
  - Test coverage for error handling
  - Mock implementation of NIP90Service
- Added integration tests with mock DVM ✅
  - Created MockDVM implementation
  - Added integration test suite
  - Test coverage for real-world scenarios
  - Simulated streaming and errors

### Phase 3: Runtime and UI Integration ⏳
- Create UI components for model selection
- Add provider to AgentLanguageModelRegistry
- Update chat UI to handle streaming updates
- Add error handling and retry logic in UI

### Phase 4: Testing and Logging ⏳
- Set up test DVMs and relays
- Add end-to-end tests
