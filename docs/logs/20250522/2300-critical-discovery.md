# Critical Discovery: Context-Level Service Resolution

## Date: 2025-05-22 23:00

## Executive Summary

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Found the REAL root cause of the persistent "Service not found: @effect/ai-openai/OpenAiLanguageModel/Config" error after the user reported the previous fix didn't work.

## Key Discovery from New Telemetry

The critical insight came from analyzing the NEW telemetry log (2251-failing-telemetry-again.md):

**LINE 44**: `agent_language_model_resolved_successfully` - ✅ **This proved the runtime fix worked!**
**LINE 46**: Still getting the Config service error **AFTER** successful resolution

## The Real Problem Revealed

The issue was NOT in the initial service resolution (which was now working), but in **subsequent operations**:

1. ✅ `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` resolves successfully from runtime
2. ❌ When `agentLM.streamText()` is called, it uses `provider.use(Effect.gen(...))`
3. ❌ This `provider.use()` creates a **NEW EXECUTION CONTEXT** 
4. ❌ The new context doesn't have `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` service
5. ❌ `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` internally calls `yield* _(OpenAiLanguageModel.Config)` and fails

## The Root Architecture Issue

```typescript
// PROBLEM: Config service provided only during provider creation
const provider = yield* _(
  Effect.provideService(
    OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...),
    OpenAiLanguageModel.Config,  // Only available during THIS Effect
    config
  )
);

// LATER: When streaming, provider.use() creates NEW context  
return agentLM.streamText(options);  // provider.use() -> NEW context without Config
```

## The Correct Solution

**Context-Level Service Provision**: The `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` service must be provided at the **Layer level**, not just during Effect execution.

### Implementation

1. **Modified Service Implementations**: Both providers now expect `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` from their execution context
2. **Modified Layer Definitions**: Layers now create the Config service from `ConfigurationService` and provide it to the service implementations
3. **Persistent Context**: Config service is available in ALL execution contexts, including `provider.use()` operations

### Code Changes

```typescript
// BEFORE: Service provided Config internally
const configuredEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffect,
  OpenAiLanguageModel.Config, 
  configValue
);

// AFTER: Service expects Config from context
const modelConfig = yield* _(OpenAiLanguageModel.Config);
const aiModelEffect = OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelConfig.model, {
  temperature: modelConfig.temperature,
  max_tokens: modelConfig.max_tokens
});

// Layer provides Config to service
export const Layer = Layer.effect(Tag, Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const config = createConfigFromConfigurationService();
  return yield* _(Effect.provideService(ServiceImpl, OpenAiLanguageModel.Config, config));
}));
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` is available in **ALL** execution contexts:
- ✅ Initial service creation
- ✅ `provider.use()` operations during streaming  
- ✅ Any other Effect operations that call `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()`

## Validation

- ✅ All 257 tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Added telemetry for Config service creation
- ✅ Applied to both Ollama and OpenAI providers

## Key Lessons

### 1. Effect Context Isolation
Effect operations create isolated contexts. Services provided in one context are not automatically available in contexts created by `provider.use()`.

### 2. Layer-Level vs Effect-Level Service Provision
- **Effect-Level**: Services available only during that Effect's execution
- **Layer-Level**: Services available to ALL Effects created by that Layer

### 3. Hidden Service Dependencies
`@effect/ai-openai`'s `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` has a hidden dependency on `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` being in the execution context, not just provided to its return value.

### 4. Runtime vs Testing Differences  
Tests passed because they used simplified contexts. The real runtime revealed the context isolation issue during actual streaming operations.

## Status: REAL FIX IMPLEMENTED

This addresses the fundamental architecture issue that was causing the persistent service resolution failures. The fix ensures proper service availability across all execution contexts.

## Testing

The user should now be able to:
1. Open Agent Chat pane
2. Send a message via Ollama/local
3. See successful streaming without Config service errors

Expected telemetry:
- `agent_language_model_resolved_successfully` (✅ already working)
- `ollama_provider_config_service_created` (new)
- `ollama_model_from_provided_config_service` (new)
- Successful streaming without errors
