# Implementation Log: Enhanced Stream Debugging

## Overview
Based on the analysis in `0618-analysis.md`, we need to add granular logging across multiple components to trace the stream lifecycle and identify why the stream appears to be cancelled prematurely.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Main Process Logging
Target file: `src/helpers/ipc/ollama/ollama-listeners.ts`
- Add request ID tracking in stream processing
- Log stream initialization
- Log individual chunk processing
- Log stream completion/error states

### 2. Renderer Process Logging - Adapter Layer âœ…
Target file: `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`
- Added comprehensive IPC stream lifecycle logging:
  - Stream initialization and parameters
  - IPC setup and configuration
  - Chunk reception and transformation
  - Stream completion and error states
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Added stream cancellation tracking

### 3. Renderer Process Logging - Language Model Layer âœ…
Target file: `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
- Added comprehensive stream chunk logging:
  - Pre-transformation chunk state
  - Transformed chunk text content
  - Final yielded chunk format
- Enhanced error logging with detailed error information
- Added stream transformation tracking

### 4. Renderer Process Logging - UI Layer
Target file: `src/hooks/ai/useAgentChat.ts`
- Log chunk reception
- Track abort controller lifecycle
- Monitor stream cleanup

## Implementation Progress

### 2024-05-22 06:18 - Language Model Layer Enhancement
1. Modified `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:
   - Added `Stream.tap` before transformation to log raw chunks
   - Enhanced chunk transformation logging
   - Added detailed error logging with stack traces
   - Added post-transformation chunk logging
   - Improved log message formatting and consistency

### 2024-05-22 06:20 - Adapter Layer Enhancement
1. Modified `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`:
   - Added detailed stream initialization logging
   - Enhanced IPC callback logging:
     - onChunk: Added chunk content and transformation logging
     - onDone: Added completion state logging
     - onError: Added detailed error state logging
   - Added stream cancellation tracking
   - Improved error handling with context-rich logging
   - Added setup error logging

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement main process logging enhancements
2. [âœ…] Implement renderer process adapter logging
3. [âœ…] Implement language model layer logging
4. [ ] Implement UI layer logging
5. [ ] Test with "hi" message and collect logs
6. [ ] Analyze complete log sequence

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete visibility into stream lifecycle
- Identification of premature cancellation point
- Understanding of stream data flow
- Clear error condition identification if present

## Status: IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„
Adapter layer and language model layer logging have been implemented. Moving on to implementing logging in the remaining components.
