# Effect AI Refactor Log - 2025-05-22 12:02

## Overview
Continuing the Effect AI upgrade from previous agents' work. Current focus is on systematically fixing TypeScript errors to complete the migration from @effect/ai 0.2.0 to 0.16.5.

## Current Type Error Count: ~150+ errors

## Priority Order:
1. File casing conflicts (blocking many imports)
2. Core exports and type definitions
3. Service access patterns and Effect usage
4. Provider implementations
5. Test file updates

## Progress Log

### 12:02 - Started systematic fixes
- Created todo list with 8 major tasks
- Identified file casing as highest priority blocker

### 12:05 - Fixed file casing conflict
- Renamed AIError.ts to AiError.ts to resolve casing conflict that was blocking imports

### 12:06 - Fixed core exports
- Updated src/services/ai/core/index.ts to export AiResponse.ts
- This provides AiTextChunk and other response types to consumers

### 12:08 - Fixed useAgentChat.ts imports and service access
- Changed AIProviderError to AiProviderError imports
- Fixed AgentLanguageModel service access using AgentLanguageModel.Tag pattern

### 12:10 - Fixed Ollama provider directory conflict
- Removed old src/services/ai/ollama directory that was conflicting
- Kept the correct implementation in src/services/ai/providers/ollama

### 12:12 - Fixed ChatOrchestratorService imports and service access
- Updated AIProviderError to AiProviderError imports
- Fixed AgentLanguageModel service access pattern

### 12:15 - Updated OpenAI provider to new @effect/ai-openai patterns
- Replaced OpenAiLanguageModel.make with OpenAiLanguageModel.model
- Updated to use provider pattern like Ollama implementation
- Added generateStructured method (stub for now)
- Fixed Layer.effect usage

### 12:18 - Fixed Ollama provider error constructors
- Removed invalid 'provider' property from AiProviderError constructors  
- Updated StreamChunk usage to AiResponse for new API compatibility

### 12:22 - Fixed NIP90 provider implementation
- Updated AiResponse import to use local class instead of @effect/ai import
- Replaced custom createAiResponse with proper constructor
- Fixed makeAgentLanguageModel usage and Layer.effect
- Fixed AiTextChunk constructor calls

### 12:25 - Fixed runtime.ts and other service access issues  
- Fixed Layer vs Effect usage in runtime.ts (OllamaAgentLanguageModelLiveLayer)
- Fixed AgentLanguageModel.Tag access in DVM service
- Fixed AIProviderError to AiProviderError references
- Fixed agentChatStore to use createJSONStorage for persistence
