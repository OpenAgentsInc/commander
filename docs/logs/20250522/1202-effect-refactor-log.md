# Effect AI Refactor Log - 2025-05-22 12:02

## Overview
Continuing the Effect AI upgrade from previous agents' work. Current focus is on systematically fixing TypeScript errors to complete the migration from @effect/ai 0.2.0 to 0.16.5.

## Current Type Error Count: ~150+ errors

## Priority Order:
1. File casing conflicts (blocking many imports)
2. Core exports and type definitions
3. Service access patterns and Effect usage
4. Provider implementations
5. Test file updates

## Progress Log

### 12:02 - Started systematic fixes
- Created todo list with 8 major tasks
- Identified file casing as highest priority blocker

### 12:05 - Fixed file casing conflict
- Renamed AIError.ts to AiError.ts to resolve casing conflict that was blocking imports

### 12:06 - Fixed core exports
- Updated src/services/ai/core/index.ts to export AiResponse.ts
- This provides AiTextChunk and other response types to consumers

### 12:08 - Fixed useAgentChat.ts imports and service access
- Changed AIProviderError to AiProviderError imports
- Fixed AgentLanguageModel service access using AgentLanguageModel.Tag pattern
