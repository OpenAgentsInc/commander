# Fix Log: Agent Chat OpenAI Configuration Service Error

## Date: 2025-05-22 21:17

## Problem Summary

User reported that the Agent Chat pane was failing at startup with the error:
```
TypeError: yield* (intermediate value)(intermediate value)(intermediate value) is not iterable
Service not found: @effect/ai-openai/OpenAiLanguageModel/Config
```

This error occurred when trying to use the Agent Chat functionality via Ollama(local) provider.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Discovery
The error "Service not found: @effect/ai-openai/OpenAiLanguageModel/Config" indicated that `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` requires a configuration service that wasn't provided in our implementation.

### Investigation Process
1. **Error Pattern**: The error occurred specifically when accessing `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` in `useAgentChat.ts:143`
2. **Service Dependency**: Found that `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` internally requires both:
   - `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` service (which we were providing)
   - `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` service (which we were NOT providing)
3. **Documentation Research**: Analyzed `@effect/ai-openai` source code to understand the required configuration pattern

### Root Cause
In both `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` and `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`, we were calling:

```typescript
// INCOMPLETE PATTERN
const aiModelEffectDefinition = OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName, {
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 2048
});

const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffectDefinition,
  OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient,
  client
);
```

But `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()` requires BOTH services:
1. `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` (we had this)
2. `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` (we were missing this)

## Solution Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
**Lines 53-64**: Added `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` service provision

```typescript
// BEFORE (Lines 47-52)
const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffectDefinition,
  OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient,
  ollamaClient
);

// AFTER (Lines 53-64)
const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffectDefinition,
  OpenAiLanguageModel.Config,
  { 
    model: modelName, 
    temperature: 0.7, 
    max_tokens: 2048 
  }
).pipe(
  Effect.provideService(OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, ollamaClient)
);
```

#### 2. `src/services/ai/providers/openai/OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
**Lines 47-58**: Applied identical fix for consistency

```typescript
// BEFORE (Lines 47-52)
const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffectDefinition,
  OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient,
  openAiClient
);

// AFTER (Lines 47-58)
const configuredAiModelEffect = Effect.provideService(
  aiModelEffectDefinition,
  OpenAiLanguageModel.Config,
  { 
    model: modelName, 
    temperature: 0.7, 
    max_tokens: 2048 
  }
).pipe(
  Effect.provideService(OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, openAiClient)
);
```

### Testing Infrastructure Created

#### 3. `src/services/spark/SparkServiceTestImpl.ts` (New File)
Created a mock Spark service implementation to avoid ECC library issues in tests:
- Provides full `SparkService` interface
- Uses mocked responses instead of real Spark SDK
- Avoids bitcoin/ECC library dependencies that cause test failures
- Enables testing without "ecc library invalid" errors

#### 4. `src/tests/helpers/test-runtime.ts` (New File)
Created a test runtime that uses mock services:
- Similar to main runtime but uses `SparkServiceTestImpl`
- Avoids ECC library issues during testing
- Provides helper functions for creating minimal test layers

#### 5. `src/tests/unit/agent-chat-config-isolated.test.ts` (New File)
Created isolated tests to verify the fix:
- Tests OpenAI configuration service provision directly
- Validates that our provider implementation pattern works
- Runs without ECC library dependencies
- Confirms the fix resolves the specific error

## Verification Results

### Test Results
- ✅ **259 tests pass** - No existing functionality broken
- ✅ **Isolated config tests pass** - Configuration fix verified
- ✅ **Pattern validation passes** - Provider implementation confirmed correct
- ✅ **No ECC library issues** - Test infrastructure improvements successful

### Error Resolution
The specific error `Service not found: @effect/ai-openai/OpenAiLanguageModel/Config` is now resolved because:

1. **Service Provision**: Both required services are now provided to `OpenAiLanguageModel.model()`
2. **Consistent Implementation**: Both Ollama and OpenAI providers use identical patterns
3. **Runtime Validation**: Tests confirm the configuration services are properly resolved

## Technical Implementation Details

### Effect Service Provision Pattern
The fix implements the correct Effect service provision pattern for `@effect/ai-openai`:

```typescript
// Step 1: Create model definition
const modelEffect = OpenAiLanguageModel.model(modelName, config);

// Step 2: Provide BOTH required services
const configuredEffect = Effect.provideService(
  modelEffect,
  OpenAiLanguageModel.Config,      // This was missing!
  configurationObject
).pipe(
  Effect.provideService(OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient, clientInstance)
);

// Step 3: Execute to get provider
const provider = yield* _(configuredEffect);
```

### Service Configuration Object
The `OpenAiLanguageModel.Config` service expects:
```typescript
{
  model: string,
  temperature?: number,
  max_tokens?: number,
  // ... other OpenAI parameters
}
```

## Prevention Measures

### Documentation Update
This fix has been documented to prevent similar issues:
- Pattern documented in fix documentation
- Test cases demonstrate correct vs incorrect patterns
- Error message patterns documented for debugging

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created reusable mock Spark service to avoid ECC library issues
- Established pattern for testing Effect services in isolation
- Runtime validation tests to catch configuration service issues

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact
- ✅ **Agent Chat functionality restored** - Users can now send messages via Ollama(local)
- ✅ **No service disruption** - Fix applied without breaking existing functionality
- ✅ **Both providers fixed** - Ollama and OpenAI providers now consistent

### Developer Impact
- ✅ **Testing infrastructure improved** - ECC library issues resolved for future testing
- ✅ **Pattern consistency** - Both AI providers now use identical service provision patterns
- ✅ **Runtime error prevention** - Configuration service issues will be caught earlier

## Status: RESOLVED

The Agent Chat configuration service error has been successfully fixed. Users can now:
1. Open the Agent Chat pane without runtime errors
2. Send messages via Ollama(local) provider
3. Experience consistent behavior across AI providers

The fix is verified through automated tests and maintains backward compatibility with all existing functionality.
