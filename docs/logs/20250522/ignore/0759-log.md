# TypeScript Error Fix Log - 2025-05-22 07:59

## Overview
This log tracks the progress of implementing fixes for TypeScript errors as outlined in `0759-instructions.md` and `06-upgrade-from-002.md`.

## Important Context from Previous Integration

Based on the successful Ollama integration and the upgrade guide, we've made several key decisions:

1. **Error Type Standardization**
   - Renamed error types to use consistent PascalCase with `Ai` prefix
   - Removed duplicate `AIConfigurationError` class
   - All error types now use `Data.TaggedError` pattern
   - Added proper `isRetryable` flag to provider errors

2. **AgentLanguageModel Interface**
   - Now extends `AiLanguageModel.Service<never>` from `@effect/ai`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy methods
   - Uses consistent option types across all methods
   - Properly implements `generateObject` with error handling

3. **Stream Processing**
   - Consistent error mapping in stream operations
   - Proper typing for stream chunks
   - Efficient stream transformation chains

4. **Error Handling**
   - Unified error types across all services
   - Consistent error mapping patterns
   - Proper retry behavior based on error types

## Completed Changes

1. **Core Error Types (`src/services/ai/core/AiError.ts`)**
   - Renamed all error types to use `Ai` prefix
   - Removed duplicate `AIConfigurationError`
   - All errors now use `Data.TaggedError` pattern
   - Added proper error properties and constructors

2. **AgentLanguageModel Interface (`src/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel.ts`)**
   - Extended `AiLanguageModel.Service<never>`
   - Added proper type exports
   - Improved option type definitions
   - Added helper for creating implementations

3. **Ollama Integration (`src/services/ai/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`)**
   - Updated to use new error types
   - Added proper error mapping with retry flags
   - Improved stream handling
   - Better type safety in response mapping

4. **Chat Orchestration (`src/services/chat/ChatOrchestratorService.ts`)**
   - Updated to use new error types
   - Improved stream handling
   - Better type safety in effect chains
   - Proper error propagation

## Next Steps

1. Update test files to use new error types and patterns
2. Fix remaining import path casing issues
3. Update other language model implementations
4. Add proper JSDoc comments for new types

## Benefits Achieved

1. Better type safety with proper error hierarchies
2. More consistent error handling across services
3. Better integration with `@effect/ai` patterns
4. Improved maintainability with standardized naming

## Notes

The changes maintain backward compatibility while aligning with `@effect/ai` patterns. This sets us up for easier future upgrades and better integration with the Effect ecosystem.
