This is excellent! The new logs from `useAgentChat.ts` confirm that the UI layer is indeed receiving and processing the chunks correctly.

**Log Analysis & Interpretation:**

1.  **Stream Initiation and AbortController:**
    *   `[useAgentChat] Created new AbortController for message: assistant-1747913587249`
    *   `[useAgentChat] Starting stream for message: assistant-1747913587249 Current signal state: {aborted: false, controller: 'present'}`
    *   This confirms the AbortController is set up correctly at the start of each new message stream.

2.  **Data Flow Through All Layers (Renderer to UI Hook):**
    *   The sequence of logs now clearly shows the data flowing:
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.streamText] Invoking ollamaAdaptedClient.stream with: ...` (Request to adapter)
        *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Starting stream for gemma3:1b with params: ...` (Adapter starts IPC)
        *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onChunk received ...` (Adapter gets chunk from IPC)
        *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Emitting StreamChunk to effect stream ...` (Adapter yields chunk)
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Pre-transform chunk: ...` (Language model layer gets chunk from adapter)
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Transformed chunk text: ...`
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Yielding chunk: {"text":"Hello"}` (Language model layer yields AiTextChunk)
        *   **`[useAgentChat runForEach] Processing chunk: {"text":"Hello"} Abort signal status: false` (UI hook receives the chunk!)**
        *   `[useAgentChat] Updated message content for: assistant-1747913587249 Chunk length: 5` (UI state updates)
    *   This complete chain is now visible and working for every token.

3.  **Stream Completion and Cleanup:**
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onDone received for gemma3:1b. Calling emit.end().`
    *   `Telemetry] {category: 'ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'create_done', ...}`
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Cancellation function executed for IPC stream with gemma3:1b. ipcStreamCancel called.`
    *   `Telemetry] {category: 'ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'cancel_requested', ...}`
    *   **`[useAgentChat] Ensuring block entered. {messageId: 'assistant-1747913587249', abortController: 'present', signalAborted: false, isLoading: false}`**
    *   **`[useAgentChat] Clearing abort controller for message: assistant-1747913587249`**
    *   **`[useAgentChat] Clearing current assistant message ID: assistant-1747913587249`**
    *   The "Ensuring block entered" log now appears *after* all chunks have been processed and the IPC stream is done. This is the correct order. The `isLoading: false` in this log indicates that `Stream.runForEach` has completed.
    *   The subsequent "Clearing abort controller" and "Clearing current assistant message ID" are part of the normal cleanup in the `ensuring` block.

4.  **Second Message Stream (Chained Conversation):**
    *   When "tell me a 1 paragrpah story" is sent, the logs show:
        *   `[useAgentChat] Created new AbortController for message: assistant-1747913604004`
        *   `[useAgentChat] Starting stream for message: assistant-1747913604004 ...`
    *   Crucially, the `conversationHistoryForLLM` sent to `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.streamText` includes the previous user message AND the assistant's full response ("Hello there! How can I help you today?"). This means conversation history is being correctly maintained and passed.
    *   The stream for the story then proceeds token by token, just like the first message.

**Conclusion:**

The streaming functionality from Ollama, through the IPC bridge, Effect AI adapter layers, and into the `useAgentChat` hook for UI updates, is **now working correctly.** The logs demonstrate the end-to-end flow of data and the proper lifecycle management of the stream and associated resources like the AbortController.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Main Process Logging (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Implement the logging in `src/helpers/ipc/ollama/ollama-listeners.ts` as previously planned. This will give you visibility into what the main process receives directly from the Ollama HTTP service and what it sends over IPC. While things are working now, this will be invaluable for future debugging if Ollama's API changes or if network issues occur between Electron's main process and the Ollama server.
    *   **Key logs to add there:**
        *   When an IPC stream request is received (`ipcMain.on(OLLAMA_CHAT_COMPLETION_STREAM_CHANNEL, ...)`).
        *   When the main process successfully calls `ollamaService.generateChatCompletionStream()`.
        *   Each chunk received *from* the Ollama service *before* sending it to the renderer (`event.sender.send(...)`).
        *   When the Ollama service stream ends or errors out in the main process.

2.  **Refinement: `mapToOpenAIMessages` and Error Handling in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   Implement the suggested simplification for `mapToOpenAIMessages` (removing the forced system message if `useAgentChat` already handles it, which it does).
    *   Implement the suggested improvement for `mapErrorToAIProviderError` for more detailed HTTP error context.

3.  **Review `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` for StreamChunk.text access:**
    *   In the `stream` method, the line:
        `Stream.map(chunk => ({ text: chunk.text?.getOrElse(() => "") || "" } as AiTextChunk))`
    *   The `chunk.text` is an `Option.Option<string>`. The `?.getOrElse(() => "")` is good. The final `|| ""` is redundant because `getOrElse` already handles the `None` case by returning the default `""`.
    *   You can simplify to:
        `Stream.map(chunk => ({ text: chunk.text.pipe(Option.getOrElse(() => "")) } as AiTextChunk))`
        Or, if you're sure `getOrElse` always returns a string (which it does):
        `Stream.map(chunk => ({ text: Option.getOrElse(chunk.text, () => "") } as AiTextChunk))`
        This is minor but cleans up the code.

4.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   Test with longer conversations.
    *   Test with different Ollama models if you have them available.
    *   Test error conditions (e.g., Ollama server down, invalid model name configured for Ollama) to see how the errors propagate and are displayed in the UI. The improved error mapping should help here.

5.  **Address Remaining TODOs (if any):**
    *   Check for any `// TODO:` comments in the AI-related files that might have been added during debugging and address them. For example, the `generateStructured` method in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` still has a placeholder for JSON parsing.

6.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Remove excessive `console.log` statements that were added for debugging, keeping only the essential ones for monitoring key lifecycle events or critical errors. The Telemetry service should be the primary way to log persistent diagnostic information.

You've made significant progress, and the core streaming mechanism seems solid now! The remaining steps are mostly about refinement, robustness, and preparing for more complex scenarios.
