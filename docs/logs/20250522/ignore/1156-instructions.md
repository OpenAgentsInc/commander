Okay, this is a classic "big refactor" TypeScript error storm! The good news is that many errors are related and stem from a few core issues due to the Effect AI package upgrade. Let's break this down.

**Overall Feedback on Agent Actions:**

Both agents (Cursor and Claude Code) made progress but also introduced or didn't fully resolve some key integration points with the new `@effect/ai` library version.

*   **Cursor Agent (Log `1126-effect-ai-upgrade-log.md`):**
    *   **Strengths:** Focused on standardizing error types (`Ai` prefix, `Data.TaggedError`), response types (`Data.TaggedClass`), and updating provider implementations to use these new types. The direction of migrating to `Data.TaggedError` is good Effect-TS practice. The note about fixing test Layer provision is also crucial.
    *   **Areas for Agent Improvement/Next Time:**
        *   The agent should ensure that when `AgentLanguageModel` (our interface) "extends `AiLanguageModel.Service`" (from `@effect/ai`), the method signatures (parameters, return types, especially error channels) are *truly* aligned or correctly adapted. Many `R = never` errors indicate a mismatch here or in how dependencies are provided.
        *   The `generateStructured` method was part of the Phase 1 plan but seems to be missing or inconsistently implemented in providers, leading to type errors.

*   **Claude Code Agent (Log `1142-effect-ai-upgrade-log-claudecode.md`):**
    *   **Strengths:** Good detailed work on `AiResponse` to add `TypeId`, `finishReason`, etc., aligning it more closely with `@effect/ai` expectations. Fixing file casing is important.
    *   **Areas for Agent Improvement/Next Time:**
        *   **Major Concern:** "Simplified AgentLanguageModel interface - Removed dependency on AiLanguageModel.Service since the API changed significantly". This is a deviation from the goal. The point of using `@effect/ai` is to leverage its abstractions. If `AiLanguageModel.Service` is the library's core interface, our `AgentLanguageModel` should strive to implement or be compatible with it. The "significant API change" needs to be understood and *adapted to*, not avoided by decoupling. This is likely a root cause for many provider implementation and testing errors.
        *   "Changed the Context tag to be part of a namespace object" (e.g., `AgentLanguageModel.Tag`) is a good pattern.

**Key Problem Areas from TypeScript Errors:**

1.  **Core Type Misalignment (`AiResponse`, `AiTextChunk`, `AgentLanguageModel`):**
    *   Our internal types in `src/services/ai/core/` (especially `AiResponse` and the `AgentLanguageModel` interface) are not fully compatible with what the new `@effect/ai` and `@effect/ai-openai` packages expect or return.
    *   Errors like "Property 'X' is missing in type 'AiResponse'" or methods on `AgentLanguageModel` not matching expected signatures are common.

2.  **File Casing Conflicts:**
    *   The `AIError.ts` vs. `AiError.ts` issue is a clear example. This needs to be standardized across all imports.

3.  **Effect-TS Usage in Implementations and Tests:**
    *   **`R = never` Mismatches:** Many errors are of the form `Effect<A, E, R_Actual>` is not assignable to `Effect<A, E, never>`. This means an Effect still has unsatisfied requirements (`R_Actual`) when it's expected to be self-contained. This usually happens when:
        *   A service method declares an `R` channel when it shouldn't (dependencies should be resolved at layer construction).
        *   An Effect is run (e.g., `Effect.runPromise`, `Effect.runFork`) without its dependencies being provided via `Effect.provideLayer(...)`.
    *   **Tag vs. Effect Instance:** Passing `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` where an `Effect<AgentLanguageModel, ...>` is expected.
    *   **Old APIs:** Using `Effect.layer` instead of `Layer.effect` or `Layer.succeed`. `Effect.provideLayer` is also a common point of failure in tests if used incorrectly (e.g. `Effect.provide(someLayer)` instead of `Effect.provideLayer(someLayer)`).

4.  **Module Resolution/Exports:**
    *   `TS2305: Module X has no exported member Y` and `TS2307: Cannot find module X`: These indicate problems with `index.ts` barrel files or incorrect import paths, often exacerbated by refactoring.

5.  **Provider Implementation Inconsistencies:**
    *   Missing methods (e.g., `generateStructured` in some providers).
    *   Incorrect API usage for the new `@effect/ai-openai` (e.g., `OpenAiLanguageModel.make` vs. `OpenAiLanguageModel.model`).

6.  **Test File Mismatches:**
    *   Mocks not updated to reflect new interface signatures or Effect-TS patterns.
    *   Incorrectly providing layers/context in tests.
    *   Error object construction in tests not matching actual error class definitions.

## Specific Instructions for Next Wave of Fixes:

The goal is to systematically resolve these errors, starting from the core and moving outwards.

**I. Foundational Fixes (Core AI Types & File System):**

1.  **File Casing (`AIError.ts` vs. `AiError.ts`):**
    *   **Action:** Standardize on `src/services/ai/core/AiError.ts`.
    *   Rename any instances of `AIError.ts` to `AiError.ts`.
    *   Search and replace all import paths globally from `"@/services/ai/core/AIError"` to `"@/services/ai/core/AiError"`.
    *   Verify `src/services/ai/core/index.ts` exports from `./AiError`.

2.  **Core Error Types (`src/services/ai/core/AiError.ts`):**
    *   **Action:** Review and ensure all custom error classes (`AiError`, `AiProviderError`, `AiConfigurationError`, `AiToolExecutionError`, `AiContextWindowError`, `AiContentPolicyError`) correctly extend `Data.TaggedError("TagName")<{ props }>` and have consistent constructor signatures.
    *   **Fix `TS2353` (Object literal may only specify known properties):** For errors like in `OpenAIClientLive.ts` or `AIError.test.ts`, ensure that when you construct errors (e.g., `new AiConfigurationError({ ... })`), the properties you pass in the constructor object are *exactly* what the error class's props generic type expects.
        *   Example: If `AiConfigurationError` is `Data.TaggedError("Tag")<{ message: string; cause?: unknown; context?: Foo }>`, then `new AiConfigurationError({ message: "...", context: "bar" })` is wrong if `context` expects `Foo`.
        *   The current `AiError.ts` has `context?: Record<string, any>;`. The `OpenAIClientLive.ts` `TS2353` errors are likely passing something like `{ message: "...", context: "some string" }` where `context` itself should be an object, or it's a typo in the property name within the test's error instantiation.
    *   **`isRetryable` Property:** For `AiProviderError`, ensure the `isRetryable` flag is handled consistently. If it's a direct property in the constructor and on the instance, access it as `err.isRetryable`. If it's part of `context`, access it as `err.context.isRetryable`. The `AiError.ts` provided indicates `isRetryable` is a constructor arg placed into `context`. The `ChatOrchestratorService.ts(56,51)` error shows it being accessed as `err.context?.isRetryable`, which is correct if it's in context, but the type error suggests `AIConfigurationError` doesn't have it (which is fine) and `AIProviderError` might not have `context` as an optional chain.
        *   **Correction for `AiProviderError` in `AiError.ts`:**
            ```typescript
            // src/services/ai/core/AiError.ts
            export class AiProviderError extends Data.TaggedError("AiProviderError")<{
              readonly message: string;
              readonly provider: string; // Make provider a direct property for easier access
              readonly cause?: unknown;
              readonly context?: Record<string, any>; // General context
              readonly isRetryable?: boolean; // Make isRetryable a direct property
            }> {
              // Constructor will need to assign these if they are direct props
              // Or, keep them in context but ensure type safety when accessing
            }
            // If isRetryable is direct, then in ChatOrchestratorService:
            // while: (err: AIProviderError | AIConfigurationError) =>
            //   err._tag === "AIProviderError" && err.isRetryable === true ...
            ```
            *Self-correction:* The provided `AiError.ts` already puts `provider` and `isRetryable` into `context`. The fix for `ChatOrchestratorService.ts(56,51)` should be to ensure the type guard for `AIProviderError` is correct and then access `err.context.isRetryable`.

3.  **Core Response Types (`src/services/ai/core/AiResponse.ts` and `AgentChatMessage.ts`):**
    *   **Action:** This is critical. `AiResponse` (from your core) *must* be compatible with `@effect/ai`'s `AiResponse` or be the `@effect/ai` type itself. The error `AiResponse' is missing the following properties from type 'AiResponse': withToolCallsJson...` in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts` is the main indicator.
    *   **File:** `src/services/ai/core/AiResponse.ts` (or wherever your `AiResponse` is defined).
        *   **Update `AiResponse`:**
            *   Import `AiResponse` from `@effect/ai` as `EffectAiResponse`.
            *   Make your local `AiResponse` extend or implement `EffectAiResponse.AiResponse`.
            *   This means adding methods like `withToolCallsJson`, `withToolCallsUnknown`, `withFunctionCallJson`, `withFunctionCallUnknown`, `withJsonMode` and properties like `[TypeId]`, `finishReason`, `parts`, `getProviderMetadata`.
            *   The implementation for these methods can be simple stubs if full functionality isn't needed *yet*, but they must exist to satisfy the type. Example:
                ```typescript
                import { AiResponse as EffectAiResponse, AiError as EffectAiError } from "@effect/ai";
                // ... other imports

                export class AiResponse extends Data.TaggedClass("AiResponse")<EffectAiResponse.Props> implements EffectAiResponse.AiResponse {
                    readonly [EffectAiResponse.TypeId]: EffectAiResponse.TypeId = EffectAiResponse.TypeId;
                    readonly text: string;
                    // ... other existing props ...
                    readonly toolCalls?: EffectAiResponse.Props["toolCalls"]; // Align with library
                    readonly metadata?: EffectAiResponse.Props["metadata"];   // Align with library

                    constructor(props: EffectAiResponse.Props) {
                        super(props);
                        this.text = props.text;
                        this.toolCalls = props.toolCalls;
                        this.metadata = props.metadata;
                    }

                    get parts(): ReadonlyArray<EffectAiResponse.Part> { /* return appropriate parts */ }
                    get finishReason(): EffectAiResponse.FinishReason { /* return reason */ }
                    getProviderMetadata<I, S>(tag: Context.Tag<I, S>): Option.Option<S> { return Option.none(); }
                    withToolCallsJson(toolCalls: any): Effect.Effect<this, EffectAiError.AiError> { return Effect.succeed(this); }
                    // ... implement other methods similarly or by delegation if wrapping ...
                }
                ```
        *   **`AiTextChunk`:** Ensure it's compatible or replaced by `@effect/ai`'s streaming chunk type. The error `src/tests/unit/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel.test.ts(7,8): Module '"@/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel"' declares 'AiTextChunk' locally, but it is not exported` implies `AiTextChunk` might be incorrectly placed or not exported. It should be in `AiResponse.ts` (or a dedicated `AiStreamTypes.ts`) and exported from `core/index.ts`.
    *   **File:** `src/services/ai/core/AgentChatMessage.ts`: Ensure `ToolCallSchema` and `AgentChatMessageSchema` are correct and exported.

4.  **`AgentLanguageModel` Interface (`src/services/ai/core/AgentLanguageModel.ts`):**
    *   **Action:** The methods (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateStructured`) must align their signatures with the new `@effect/ai` patterns.
        *   The error channel `E` should be `AiProviderError` (or a union including it).
        *   The requirement channel `R` for these methods should be `never` because the service instance itself (`AgentLanguageModel`) will be provided to Effects that use these methods. The dependencies of `AgentLanguageModel` (like a specific HTTP client or config) are resolved when its `Layer` is built.
        *   **Example method signature:**
            ```typescript
            generateText(options: GenerateTextOptions): Effect.Effect<AiResponse, AiProviderError, never>;
            streamText(options: StreamTextOptions): Stream.Stream<AiTextChunk, AiProviderError, never>;
            generateStructured(options: GenerateStructuredOptions): Effect.Effect<AiResponse, AiProviderError, never>;
            ```
    *   Ensure `AgentLanguageModel.Tag` and the interface are exported.

5.  **`src/services/ai/core/index.ts`:**
    *   **Action:** Verify this file exports *all* necessary types and tags from the `core` directory (e.g., `AiError` and all its subtypes, `AiResponse`, `AiTextChunk`, `AgentLanguageModel` Tag and interface, `AgentChatMessageSchema`, `ToolCallSchema`, `ProviderConfig` types). This will fix many `TS2305` errors.

**II. Provider Implementations:**

1.  **General Approach for all providers (`OpenAI`, `Ollama`, `NIP90`):**
    *   **Implement `AgentLanguageModel`:** Ensure each provider's `Live` service (e.g., `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive`) correctly implements all methods of the *updated* `AgentLanguageModel` interface, including `generateStructured`. If a provider doesn't support a feature, `Effect.fail` with an appropriate `AiProviderError`.
    *   **Parameter/Response Adaptation:** Adapt the parameters passed to the underlying `@effect/ai` library methods and adapt the responses back to your application's (now aligned) `AiResponse`/`AiTextChunk` types. This is where `mapProviderResponseToAiResponse` and similar mappers for errors come in.
    *   **Error Mapping:** Consistently use your `mapToAiProviderError` or similar to wrap errors from the underlying library into `AiProviderError`.
    *   **Layer Construction:**
        *   Each `XxxAgentLanguageModelLive` should be an `Effect` that yields the service implementation.
        *   The exported layer should be `Layer.effect(AgentLanguageModel.Tag, XxxAgentLanguageModelLiveEffect)`.
        *   This `XxxAgentLanguageModelLiveEffect` will use `yield* _(...)` to get its dependencies (like the specific client for that provider, `ConfigurationService`, `TelemetryService`).

2.  **`src/services/ai/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   **Fix `TS2307: Cannot find module './OllamaClient'` / `'./OllamaConfig'`:**
        *   These modules are likely no longer separate. `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` should provide the `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` (which is an alias for `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient`).
        *   `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` should then depend on `OllamaOpenAIClientTag` and use `OpenAiLanguageModel.model(...)` with it, as described in `AI-PHASE04.md`.
        *   Configuration for Ollama (like model name, default temp) should come from `ConfigurationService`.

3.  **`src/services/ai/providers/openai/OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   **Fix `TS2339: Property 'make' does not exist...`:**
        *   Replace `OpenAiLanguageModel.make` with `OpenAiLanguageModel.model("your-model-name")`. This returns an `AiModel` effect.
        *   This `AiModel` effect needs the `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` to be provided to it.
        *   Then, `yield* _(builtAiModel)` to get the `Provider<AiLanguageModel.Service>`, and use its methods.
    *   The layer should provide `AgentLanguageModel.Tag`.

4.  **`src/services/ai/providers/nip90/NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   **Fix `TS2322: Type 'AiResponse' is missing...`:** This will be fixed by updating your core `AiResponse` type (Step I.3).
    *   **Fix Layer Construction:** Change `Layer.succeed(AgentLanguageModel.Tag, NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive)` to `Layer.effect(AgentLanguageModel.Tag, NIP90AgentLanguageModelLiveEffect)` where `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLiveEffect` is the `Effect.gen` block that constructs the service.

5.  **Client Layers (`OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`, `OpenAIClientLive.ts`):**
    *   **`OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts`:**
        *   `TS2305: ... "StreamChunk"`: The `stream` method in `OpenAiClient.Service` returns `Stream.Stream<AiResponse.AiResponse, ...>`. Each item in this stream is a full `AiResponse` object, potentially representing a chunk if `finishReason` isn't "stop". You should adapt this to your `AiTextChunk` if your `AgentLanguageModel.streamText` expects `AiTextChunk`. If `StreamChunk` was a specific class from the older `@effect/ai-openai`, you'll need to find its equivalent or adapt.
        *   **Crucially for `TS2740` (missing properties from `Client`):** The `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` provides `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient`. The `OpenAiClient.Service` interface from `@effect/ai-openai@0.19.5` (see `OpenAiClient.d.ts`) has a `client: Generated.Client` property and a top-level `stream` method. Your implementation in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` (from `AI-PHASE04.md`) needs to match this structure.
            *   The `client` property needs to implement all methods from `Generated.Client`. You've stubbed many, which is fine for now, but ensure `createChatCompletion` is correctly implemented and typed.
            *   The top-level `stream` method in your implementation should correctly call the IPC bridge and adapt its SSE events into a `Stream.Stream<AiResponse.AiResponse, HttpClientError.HttpClientError>`. Each `AiResponse` in the stream would represent a chunk.
    *   **`OpenAIClientLive.ts`:** Fix `AiConfigurationError` constructor calls (e.g., the `context` property issue, `TS2353`). Ensure the `message`, `cause`, and `context` (if any) passed match the error class definition.

**III. Orchestration and Hooks:**

1.  **`src/services/ai/orchestration/ChatOrchestratorService.ts`:**
    *   **Fix `TS2305` and `TS2724`:** Ensure correct imports from your fixed `core` types.
    *   **Fix `TS2345` (Tag vs Effect):** When using `AgentLanguageModel.Tag`, get the service instance via `yield* _(AgentLanguageModel.Tag)` or `Effect.service(AgentLanguageModel.Tag)`.
    *   **Fix `R = never` issues (`TS2322`):**
        *   The `activeAgentLM` (which is `AgentLanguageModel`) is already resolved when `ChatOrchestratorServiceLive` is built. Effects/Streams returned by `activeAgentLM.streamText` or `activeAgentLM.generateText` should already have `R = never` if the `AgentLanguageModel` interface and its implementations are correct.
        *   If errors persist here, it means `activeAgentLM`'s methods are still incorrectly typed with an `R` channel.
        *   The `AiPlan.make` logic in `streamConversation` takes `model` effects that yield a `Provider`. Ensure `getResolvedAiModelProvider` provides all necessary client contexts so that the effect it returns has its `R` channel correctly narrowed (ideally to `never` if the provider is self-contained after client injection).

2.  **`src/hooks/ai/useAgentChat.ts`:**
    *   Fix imports.
    *   Ensure `Effect.runFork` is called on an `Effect<A, E, never>`. Provide `runtimeRef.current` to the program being forked: `Effect.runFork(program.pipe(Effect.provide(runtimeRef.current)))`.

**IV. Other Services (`src/services/chat/`, `src/services/dvm/`):**

1.  **Fix `TS2307` (Cannot find module):** For `src/services/chat/ChatOrchestratorService.ts`, check import paths for `./ChatMessage`, `./ChatSession`, etc. and ensure these files exist and export the members from `src/services/chat/index.ts`.
2.  **Fix `TS2693` ('Context' only refers to a type):** If you mean `Context.Tag`, use `MyService.Tag`. If you mean `Context.get`, use `Context.get(ctx, MyService.Tag)`.

**V. Runtime (`src/services/runtime.ts`):**

1.  **Fix `TS2345` (Layer assignment error):**
    *   The error `Argument of type '<RIn2, E2, ROut2>(self: Layer<ROut2, E2, RIn2>) => Layer<ROut2, ConfigError | E2, Exclude<RIn2, OpenAiClient | ...>>' is not assignable to parameter of type '(_: Effect<AgentLanguageModel, unknown, unknown>) => Layer<unknown, unknown, unknown>'.` is complex.
    *   It suggests that a `Layer.provide` call is expecting an Effect as its input for a transformation function, but it's receiving a Layer composition function.
    *   The pipe structure for `ollamaLanguageModelLayer` and `kind5050DVMLayer` needs careful review. `Layer.provide` expects the layer to be provided *to* and the layer *of dependencies*.
        ```typescript
        // Example:
        const ollamaLanguageModelLayer = OllamaProvider.OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.pipe(
            Layer.provide(baseLayer) // Assuming baseLayer contains dependencies for OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive
        );
        ```
        The error likely means `ollamaAdapterLayer` is the `Effect` and `baseLayer` is the `Layer` of dependencies, or vice-versa, and the `Layer.provide` signature isn't matching.
        The structure `LayerA.pipe(Layer.provide(LayerB))` means LayerB's outputs are provided as inputs to LayerA. Ensure this flow is correct for all nested layers.

**VI. Store (`src/stores/ai/agentChatStore.ts`):**

1.  **Fix `TS2322` (PersistStorage):**
    *   **Action:** Use `createJSONStorage` from `zustand/middleware`.
        ```typescript
        import { createJSONStorage } from "zustand/middleware";
        // ...
        storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage),
        ```
        This was already in your `pane.ts`, so apply it here.

**VII. Test Files:**

1.  **General Strategy for Tests:**
    *   **Fix `TS2345` (Tag vs Effect/Tag errors):**
        *   Do not pass `Context.Tag` instances directly to `Effect.flatMap`, `Effect.succeed`, or functions expecting a service instance.
        *   Use `Effect.service(MyTag)` or `yield* _(MyTag)` within an `Effect.gen` to get the service instance.
    *   **Fix `TS2339: Property 'provideLayer' does not exist on type 'typeof Effect'`:**
        *   This is a key fix. Ensure you are importing `provideLayer` correctly or use the full path if it's namespaced differently in your Effect version. It should be `Effect.provideLayer`.
        *   `Effect.runPromise(myEffect.pipe(Effect.provideLayer(myTestLayer)))`.
    *   **Fix `TS2339: Property 'of' does not exist on type 'typeof AiProviderError'`:**
        *   Custom errors extending `Data.TaggedError` are typically instantiated with `new MyErrorClass({ ...props })`. The `.of()` static method is not automatically provided unless you add it. Change `AiProviderError.of(...)` to `new AiProviderError(...)`.
    *   **Fix `AiGenericError` not exported:** Ensure `AiGenericError` is exported from `AiError.ts` and `core/index.ts`.
    *   **Error object construction in tests (`TS2353`):** Review `AIError.test.ts`. When creating error instances, make sure the properties passed to the constructor match the class definition exactly. If `provider` or `context` are part of the constructor arguments but then stored differently (e.g., nested inside a `context` property on the error instance), assertions must reflect that.
    *   **`OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` (`TS2345: "make" is not assignable...`):**
        *   The `vi.spyOn(OpenAiLanguageModel, "make")` is incorrect because `OpenAiLanguageModel` (from `@effect/ai-openai@0.19.5`) likely doesn't have a static `make` method in the way the old version might have. It has `OpenAiLanguageModel.model("name")` which returns an `Effect<AiModel<...>>` or `OpenAiLanguageModel.make({ client, model, ... })` which returns an `Effect<AiLanguageModel.Service,...>`.
        *   You should mock the dependencies of `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive` (i.e., `OpenAiClient.OpenAiClient` and `ConfigurationService`) and test that `OpenAIAgentLanguageModelLive` uses them correctly to interact with the (mocked) OpenAI services.
    *   **`R = never` errors in tests (`TS2345`):** Ensure all test Effects passed to `Effect.runPromise` or `Effect.runPromiseExit` have their dependencies fully provided via `Effect.provideLayer(testLayer)`.

**Priority for Fixing:**

1.  File Casing.
2.  Core AI Types (`AiError.ts`, `AiResponse.ts`, `AgentChatMessage.ts`, `AgentLanguageModel.ts`, `ProviderConfig.ts`) and their exports from `core/index.ts`.
3.  Provider Implementations (making them conform to the new core `AgentLanguageModel` interface).
4.  Client Adapter Layers (especially `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` to fully implement `OpenAiClient.Service`).
5.  Orchestration and Hooks.
6.  `runtime.ts`.
7.  Store.
8.  Test files (these will be easier once the main code types correctly).

This systematic approach should help untangle the errors. Good luck!
