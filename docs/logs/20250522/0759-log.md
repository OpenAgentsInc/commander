# TypeScript Error Fix Log - 2025-05-22 07:59

## Overview
This log tracks the progress of implementing fixes for TypeScript errors as outlined in `0759-instructions.md`.

## Important Context from Previous Integration

Based on the successful Ollama integration (see `docs/logs/20250522/ignore/0635-analysis.md`), we made several key decisions about @effect/ai usage that should inform our current fixes:

1. **Stream Processing Pattern**
   - The successful pattern uses `Stream.asyncInterrupt` in adapter layers
   - Chunks flow through multiple layers: Adapter -> Language Model -> UI
   - Each layer transforms the chunks appropriately for its level of abstraction

2. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Direct error mapping in language model implementations
   - `AIProviderError` includes `isRetryable` as a direct property, not nested under context
   - HTTP errors are mapped with detailed status and response information

3. **Provider Configuration**
   - Provider-specific configuration is injected via Effect layers
   - Model configuration is passed through the standard options interface
   - Each provider implements its own configuration tag and schema

4. **Message Format Standardization**
   - Messages are consistently formatted across providers
   - System messages are handled at the UI/hook level, not forced by providers
   - Tool messages follow a standard structure

These patterns should be maintained while fixing the current TypeScript errors.

## Progress Log

### Starting State
Running initial type check to establish baseline...

```
pnpm run t
```

### Fix 1: useConfigurationService.ts - Context.get usage
1. Initial attempt: Added Context import from effect/Context and changed to static method call
   - Result: New error TS2693: 'Context' only refers to a type
   - Next step: Need to correct the import to get the runtime Context value

2. Second attempt: Updated import to `import * as Context from "effect/Context"`
   - Result: Success! The Context-related error is now fixed.

### Fix 2: ChatOrchestratorService.ts - @effect/ai imports and usage
Starting work on multiple errors in this file:
1. No exported member 'Provider'
2. No exported member 'AiPlan'
3. Schedule type mismatch
4. isRetryable property missing
5. builtPlan unknown type

Investigation:
1. Checked @effect/ai package version: ^0.2.0
2. Examined package exports and found that the structure is different than expected
3. Found that our successful Ollama integration uses a simpler pattern:
   - Direct Effect.retry instead of AiPlan for retries
   - Provider types defined at the language model level
   - Stream transformation chain for chunk processing

Recommended Approach:
1. Remove AiPlan usage entirely
2. Use the proven Ollama integration pattern:
   ```typescript
   streamConversation: ({ messages, preferredProvider, options }) => {
     runTelemetry({ category: "orchestrator", action: "stream_conversation_start", label: preferredProvider.key });

     const streamOptions: StreamTextOptions = {
       ...options,
       prompt: JSON.stringify({ messages }),
       model: preferredProvider.modelName,
     };

     return activeAgentLM.streamText(streamOptions).pipe(
       Effect.tapError((err) => runTelemetry({
         category: "orchestrator",
         action: "stream_error",
         label: (err as Error).message
       }))
     );
   }
   ```

This simpler approach:
- Removes dependency on @effect/ai exports that don't exist in 0.2.0
- Uses proven patterns from our working Ollama integration
- Maintains consistent error handling across providers
- Preserves the streaming functionality that works in production

Next Steps:
1. Update imports to match actual 0.2.0 package structure
2. Rewrite retry logic using Effect.retry with proper Schedule
3. Add proper type annotations to all Effect.gen blocks
4. Fix Stream error type handling

## Core Interface Implementation

We have successfully implemented the core interfaces for our AI integration:

1. Created `AiError.ts` with:
   - Base `AiError` class for all AI-related errors
   - Provider-specific error types
   - Error mapping functions

2. Created `AiResponse.ts` with:
   - `AiResponse` class for structured responses
   - `AiTextChunk` class for streaming
   - Response mapping functions

3. Created `AgentLanguageModel.ts` that:
   - Extends `AiLanguageModel` from `@effect/ai`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with our existing interface
   - Provides helper function `makeAgentLanguageModel` for implementations

## Ollama Integration

Updated `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` to:
- Use the new `AgentLanguageModel` interface
- Map Ollama responses to our `AiResponse` type
- Handle streaming with proper error mapping
- Integrate with configuration service

## Chat Orchestration

Updated `ChatOrchestratorService.ts` to:
- Use the new `AgentLanguageModel` interface
- Properly handle streaming and response generation
- Maintain chat session state
- Map errors consistently

## Next Steps

1. Update tests to use new interfaces
2. Verify error handling across all components
3. Test streaming functionality
4. Document new patterns in architecture docs

## Benefits

1. Better type safety with proper error types
2. Consistent response structure
3. Improved streaming support
4. Easier integration of new AI providers

## Notes

The new implementation maintains compatibility with existing code while providing a path forward for future improvements. The `AgentLanguageModel` interface successfully bridges our needs with the `@effect/ai` package's patterns.
