# TypeScript Error Fix Log - 2025-05-22 07:59

## Overview
This log tracks the progress of implementing fixes for TypeScript errors as outlined in `0759-instructions.md`.

## Progress Log

### Starting State
Running initial type check to establish baseline...

```
pnpm run t
```

### Fix 1: useConfigurationService.ts - Context.get usage
1. Initial attempt: Added Context import from effect/Context and changed to static method call
   - Result: New error TS2693: 'Context' only refers to a type
   - Next step: Need to correct the import to get the runtime Context value

2. Second attempt: Will update import to get the correct Context value
