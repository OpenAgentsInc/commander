Excellent! The logs show progress and help pinpoint the next area to investigate.

**Log Analysis & Interpretation:**

1.  **Request Formatting Corrected:**
    *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.streamText] Invoking ollamaAdaptedClient.stream with: ...`
    *   This log confirms your previous fix worked. The `messages` array is now correctly formatted as an array of message objects, not a nested JSON string. This is a good step forward.

2.  **IPC Stream Lifecycle:**
    *   `ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'create_start'`: The Ollama adapter (IPC client in the renderer) initiates the stream request to the main process.
    *   `ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'create_done'`: The Ollama adapter reports that the stream creation/initialization phase (from its perspective with the IPC bridge) is "done." This likely means the main process has acknowledged the stream request and set up its side. **It does not mean the LLM has finished generating tokens.**
    *   `ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'cancel_requested'`: This is the key log. It appears immediately after `create_done`.

3.  **No Chunks Received by UI Layer:**
    *   There are no logs from `useAgentChat.ts` indicating that any `AiTextChunk` was received or processed.
    *   The `send_message_start` is logged, but no corresponding `send_message_success` or `send_message_failure_stream`.

**Conclusion from Logs:**

The issue is no longer the request format sent *to* the `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` adapter. The problem now lies in the stream handling *after* the adapter initiates the IPC call, or potentially within the IPC bridge/main process itself. The stream seems to be established at the IPC level (`create_done`) but then immediately cancelled (`cancel_requested`) before any actual content chunks from the LLM are processed by the UI hook (`useAgentChat.ts`).

This premature cancellation could happen for a few reasons:

*   **Rapid State Change in `useAgentChat.ts`:** If `isLoading` or another dependency in `useAgentChat.ts` changes in a way that causes the `useEffect` cleanup (which aborts the stream) to run too soon.
*   **IPC Bridge `onDone` Misinterpretation:** The `ollamaIPC.generateChatCompletionStream`'s `onDone` callback in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` might be called prematurely by the main process if the Ollama API stream itself ends very quickly (e.g., an error occurs immediately at Ollama, or it sends an empty stream and closes). If `emit.end()` is called too soon, the `Stream.runForEach` in `useAgentChat` will complete, and the `ensuring` block might trigger the cancellation.
*   **Error in Main Process Stream Handling:** An error could be occurring in `ollama-listeners.ts` while trying to stream from the actual Ollama service, causing it to terminate the stream to the renderer early.

**Next Steps: Add More Granular Logging to Pinpoint the Stream Interruption**

We need to trace where the stream data stops flowing or where the cancellation is triggered.

**Instructions to the Agent:**

1.  **File: `src/helpers/ipc/ollama/ollama-listeners.ts` (Main Process)**
    *   **Inside the `ipcMain.on(OLLAMA_CHAT_COMPLETION_STREAM_CHANNEL, ...)` handler:**
        *   **Before `Stream.runForEach(stream, ...)`:**
            *   Add: `console.log(\`[IPC Listener - Main Process] (${requestId}) ollamaService stream obtained. Starting to process chunks.\`);`
        *   **Inside the `processChunkEffect` function (or equivalent logic that handles each chunk from `ollamaService`):**
            *   Modify the existing log or add a new one to be more explicit:
              `console.log(\`[IPC Listener - Main Process] (${requestId}) Chunk from ollamaService (count: ${chunkCounter[requestId]}): \`, JSON.stringify(chunk).substring(0,100));`
              `event.sender.send(...);`
        *   **Inside the success path of `Effect.runPromiseExit(streamProcessingEffect)` (where `:done` is sent):**
            *   Add: `console.log(\`[IPC Listener - Main Process] (${requestId}) Stream processing finished successfully. Sent :done to renderer.\`);`
        *   **Inside the failure path (where `:error` is sent or an error is caught):**
            *   Log the specific error before sending it:
              `console.error(\`[IPC Listener - Main Process] (${requestId}) Stream processing error: \`, Cause.pretty(finalExit.cause));`
              `event.sender.send(..., errorForIPC);`

2.  **File: `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive.ts` (Renderer Process)**
    *   **Inside the `stream` method:**
        *   **`onChunk` callback:**
            *   Change: `console.log(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onChunk received for ${params.model}: \`, JSON.stringify(chunk).substring(0,100));`
            *   Add *after* `emit.single(streamChunk)`: `console.log(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Emitted StreamChunk to effect stream for ${params.model}\`);`
        *   **`onDone` callback:**
            *   Change: `console.log(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onDone received for ${params.model}. Calling emit.end().\`);`
        *   **`onError` callback:**
            *   Change: `console.error(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onError received for ${params.model}: \`, error);`
            *   Add *before* `emit.fail(...)`: `console.log(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Calling emit.fail() for ${params.model}.\`);`
        *   **Inside the `return Effect.sync(() => { ... });` (cancellation function):**
            *   Add: `console.log(\`[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Cancellation function executed for IPC stream with ${params.model}. ipcStreamCancel called.\`);`

3.  **File: `src/services/ai/providers/ollama/OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` (Renderer Process)**
    *   **Inside `streamText` method:**
        *   Modify the `Stream.tap` to log the actual content:
          `Stream.tap(chunk => Effect.sync(() => console.log("[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Yielding chunk.text: ", chunk.text)))`

4.  **File: `src/hooks/ai/useAgentChat.ts` (Renderer Process)**
    *   **Inside the `Stream.runForEach(textStream, (chunk: AiTextChunk) => ...)` callback:**
        *   Change: `console.log("[useAgentChat] Received AiTextChunk from orchestrator/LLM:", JSON.stringify(chunk));`
    *   **In the `Effect.ensuring` block:**
        *   Change: `console.log("[useAgentChat] Ensuring block entered. Current AbortController:", streamAbortControllerRef.current, "IsLoading:", isLoading);`
        *   Right before `streamAbortControllerRef.current.abort();` (if it's called):
            `console.log("[useAgentChat] Ensuring: ABORTING stream.", streamAbortControllerRef.current);`

After adding these logs, please run the "hi" chat message scenario again and provide the **full console output from both the main and renderer processes.** We need to see the sequence of these new logs to understand where the stream gets dropped or why it's cancelled. Pay close attention to the `requestId` in the main process logs to correlate them.
