Okay, this new set of logs is very informative!

**Log Analysis & Interpretation:**

1.  **Correct Request Formatting (Confirmed Again):**
    *   The log `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.streamText] Invoking ollamaAdaptedClient.stream with: ...` shows the `messages` array is correctly structured. This is good.

2.  **IPC Stream Lifecycle (Renderer - Adapter):**
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Starting stream for gemma3:1b with params: ... "stream": true`
    *   `Telemetry] {category: 'ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'create_start', ...}`
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Setting up IPC stream for gemma3:1b`
    *   These show the adapter preparing and initiating the IPC stream.

3.  **Chunks Flowing Through All Layers (Renderer):**
    *   This is the **key improvement** shown in these logs:
        *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onChunk received for gemma3:1b: {"id":"chatcmpl-481",... "delta":{"content":"You"}}`
        *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Emitting StreamChunk to effect stream for gemma3:1b: {"parts":[{"_tag":"Content","content":"You"}]}`
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Pre-transform chunk: {"parts":[{"_tag":"Content","content":"You"}]}`
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Transformed chunk text: You`
        *   `[OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive streamText] Yielding chunk: {"text":"You"}`
    *   This sequence repeats correctly for each token (" can", " call", etc.), indicating that:
        *   The main process is sending chunks.
        *   `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` (adapter) is receiving them via IPC.
        *   The adapter is correctly transforming them into `OpenAiClient.StreamChunk` and emitting them into its Effect `Stream`.
        *   `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` (language model layer) is receiving these `StreamChunk`s.
        *   It's transforming them into `AiTextChunk` (which is `{ text: string }`).
        *   It's yielding these `AiTextChunk`s.
    *   **This means the stream is now successfully flowing all the way from the main process, through the IPC and adapter layers, and out of the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` service.**

4.  **Stream Completion and Cancellation (Normal Path):**
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] IPC onDone received for gemma3:1b. Calling emit.end().`
    *   `Telemetry] {category: 'ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'create_done', ...}`
    *   This indicates the main process signaled the end of the stream from Ollama.
    *   `[OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive] Cancellation function executed for IPC stream with gemma3:1b. ipcStreamCancel called.`
    *   `Telemetry] {category: 'ollama_adapter:stream', action: 'cancel_requested', ...}`
    *   This is the cleanup function of `Stream.asyncInterrupt` in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive` being called. This is **expected behavior** when the stream completes successfully. It signifies that the Effect `Stream` pipeline that was consuming data from the IPC bridge has finished.

**Inference:**

The UI is now working because the data is flowing correctly through the AI service layers in the renderer. The previous issue of the stream getting cancelled *prematurely* (before chunks were processed) due to an upstream problem in the data flow or adapter seems resolved.

The fact that the `cancel_requested` log appears *after* all chunks and `create_done` signifies a normal stream lifecycle completion from the perspective of the Effect `Stream` defined in `OllamaAsOpenAIClientLive`.

**Next Steps & Recommendations:**

1.  **Verify UI Update in `useAgentChat.ts`:**
    *   Even though the logs confirm data flow up to `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive`, the final confirmation is that `useAgentChat.ts` is receiving these chunks and updating the UI.
    *   **Action:** Add the log line `console.log("[useAgentChat runForEach] Processing chunk:", JSON.stringify(chunk), "Abort signal status:", signal.aborted);` as the *very first line* inside the `Stream.runForEach` callback in `src/hooks/ai/useAgentChat.ts`.
    *   Run the chat again. You should now see these logs interspersed with the "Yielding chunk" logs from `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive`. This will give 100% confidence that the UI hook is consuming the data.

2.  **Review `mapToOpenAIMessages` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   The current implementation of `mapToOpenAIMessages` might be overly complex in ensuring a system message if the incoming `messagesPayload` (from parsed `params.prompt`) should already conform to a structure that includes a system message if needed.
    *   The OpenAI API and Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint are generally flexible; if no system message is provided, the model typically proceeds with the user/assistant messages.
    *   **Consider simplifying:**
        ```typescript
        const mapToOpenAIMessages = (messages: AgentChatMessage[]) => {
          return messages.map(msg => ({
            role: msg.role as "system" | "user" | "assistant" | "tool",
            content: msg.content || "", // Ensure content is always a string
            name: msg.name, // Will be undefined if not present, which is fine
            tool_calls: msg.tool_calls as any,
            tool_call_id: msg.tool_call_id,
          }));
        };
        ```
        And then in `streamText` and `generateText`:
        ```typescript
        // ...
        const messagesFromPrompt = parsePromptMessages(params.prompt);
        const openAiMessages = mapToOpenAIMessages(messagesFromPrompt);

        const streamRequest: StreamCompletionRequest = {
          model: params.model || modelName,
          messages: openAiMessages, // Directly use the mapped messages
          // ... other params
        };
        // ...
        ```
        This relies on `useAgentChat.ts` (or whatever constructs the `params.prompt` JSON) to include the system message if it's always required. Your `useAgentChat` *does* prepend the system message before stringifying, so this simplification should be safe and cleaner.

3.  **Error Handling Refinement in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:**
    *   In `mapErrorToAIProviderError`, the `detail` extraction could be more robust:
        ```typescript
        const mapErrorToAIProviderError = (err: unknown, contextAction: string, params: any): AIProviderError => {
          let messageContent = "Unknown provider error";
          let causeContent: unknown = err;

          if (typeof err === 'object' && err !== null) {
            if ('_tag' in err && (err as any)._tag === "ResponseError") { // HttpClientError.ResponseError
              const responseError = err as any;
              messageContent = `HTTP error ${responseError.response?.status}: ${responseError.response?.body || responseError.message || String(err)}`;
              causeContent = responseError.cause || err;
            } else if (err instanceof Error) {
              messageContent = err.message;
              causeContent = err.cause || err;
            } else {
              messageContent = String(err);
            }
          } else {
            messageContent = String(err);
          }

          const finalMessage = `Ollama ${contextAction} error for model ${modelName}: ${messageContent}`;
          // ... rest of AIProviderError construction
        };
        ```
    *   This helps capture more specific HTTP error details if they come from the `HttpClientError` family.

4.  **Main Process Logging (`ollama-listeners.ts`):**
    *   Although things are working, it's still good practice to implement the logging you planned for the main process IPC handlers (`ollama-listeners.ts`). This will be invaluable for debugging future issues related to IPC or the main-process Ollama service interaction.
    *   Specifically, logging chunks as they are received *from* Ollama by the main process and *before* they are sent over IPC to the renderer will complete the E2E trace.

5.  **Review Telemetry:**
    *   Ensure the telemetry events being logged (`ollama_adapter:stream` actions) provide meaningful insight and are correctly categorized. The current ones seem reasonable.

**Summary of Next Steps for the Agent:**

*   **Primary:** Add the `console.log` inside `Stream.runForEach` in `useAgentChat.ts` to confirm UI consumption.
*   **Recommended Refinement:** Simplify `mapToOpenAIMessages` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`.
*   **Recommended Refinement:** Improve `mapErrorToAIProviderError` in `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts`.
*   **Good Practice:** Implement the planned logging in `src/helpers/ipc/ollama/ollama-listeners.ts`.

The application is much closer to a fully working state for Ollama streaming. The current logs show the data pipeline is functioning up to the point where `useAgentChat` should be receiving the chunks.
