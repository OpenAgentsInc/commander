# Fix for AgentLanguageModel Service Not Found Error

## Issue
Application was failing to start with error: `Error: Service not found: AgentLanguageModel`

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to stem from the `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file where we previously created a mock implementation of `OpenAiLanguageModel`. This mock implementation is not correctly providing the `AgentLanguageModel` service to the application layer.

## Implementation Plan
Following the instructions, I'll:
1. Remove any local mock of `OpenAiLanguageModel`
2. Ensure correct imports from `@effect/ai` and `@effect/ai-openai`
3. Implement `OllamaAgentLanguageModelLive` using the real library components
4. Verify the changes with TypeScript checking and application startup
