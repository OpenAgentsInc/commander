# Pane Dragging Fixes Log

## Initial Analysis - 7:58 AM

After reviewing the pane dragging issues outlined in 0758-panefix-instructions.md, I've identified two main problems:

1. **Non-active pane drag stops (~20px issue):**
   - When a non-active pane is clicked to drag, it becomes active
   - This state change triggers useEffect hooks in useResizeHandlers
   - If the pane position in the store changes as a result, it causes the local state to reset
   - This disrupts the useDrag operation's offset calculation, causing the drag to "stop"

2. **Choppy drag for active pane (lag issue):**
   - The Pane component has CSS transitions (transition-all duration-100 ease-out)
   - These transitions conflict with direct style updates during dragging
   - The result is laggy, choppy movement instead of direct cursor following

I'll be implementing the fixes described in the instructions to address both issues.

## Implementation - 8:05 AM

### Step 1: Beginning Pane Component Update

Now I'll begin updating the Pane.tsx component. My approach includes:

1. Adding interaction state tracking (isDragging, isResizing) to prevent state resets during gestures
2. Adding conditional application of CSS transitions
3. Implementing a more robust resize handler system
4. Fixing the issue with bringPaneToFront by only calling it when necessary

The changes will need to be quite extensive, requiring modifications to both the core Pane component and the useResizeHandlers hook.

## Implementation - 8:15 AM

### Step 2: Completed Pane.tsx Update

I've implemented the fixes to the Pane.tsx component:

1. **Added Interaction State Tracking:**
   - Added `isDragging` and `isResizing` states to track when a pane is being manipulated
   - Created an `isInteracting` derived value to simplify conditional logic

2. **Improved useResizeHandlers:**
   - Added conditional logic to the useEffect hooks to prevent state resets during interaction
   - Completely refactored the resize handler system to use a factory function pattern
   - Added parameter validation to prevent unwanted coordinate changes during specific resize operations
   - Used a more structured memo approach for tracking initial position and size during resize

3. **Conditional CSS Transitions:**
   - Modified the main pane container className to only apply transitions when not interacting
   - This prevents the transition animation from fighting with the direct style changes during drag/resize

4. **Smart bringPaneToFront Logic:**
   - Modified the handlePaneMouseDown to only call bringPaneToFront when the pane isn't already active
   - This avoids unnecessary state updates which could interfere with dragging

5. **Improved Drag Handler:**
   - Added active state tracking to the drag handler
   - Explicit update of local state for immediate feedback during drag
   - Store update only happens on drag end

These changes should eliminate both the non-active pane drag stopping issue and the choppy movement during drag operations.

## Testing - 8:20 AM

Testing the implemented changes to verify the fixes work as expected:

1. Non-active pane drag issue (20px stop bug):
   - When dragging a non-active pane, it should now continue to follow the cursor smoothly
   - The local state won't reset during dragging because we've added the isInteracting check

2. Choppy drag for active panes:
   - Active panes should now move smoothly with the cursor without any lag or choppiness
   - This is achieved by removing the CSS transitions during interaction
