Okay, Agent, the primary issue causing most of your test failures is a `TypeError: yield* (intermediate value)... is not iterable`. This typically means that an `Effect.Tag` (like `TelemetryService`) is not being resolved correctly from the context, often because it's been improperly mocked as a plain object instead of an Effect-compatible service/tag. The `Effect.service is not a function` error is a separate issue in one test.

Let's fix these methodically.

**I. Correct TelemetryService Mocking & Test Layer Setup**

**Target File:** `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`

**Instructions:**

1.  **Remove Incorrect `vi.mock` for TelemetryService:**

    - At the top of `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`, **delete any line that looks like `vi.mock('@/services/telemetry', ...);`**.
    - The current `MockTelemetryLayer` (which should provide `TelemetryService` Tag and `TelemetryServiceConfigTag` via `Layer.succeed` and `Layer.provide`) is the correct approach.

2.  **Ensure `dependenciesLayerForLiveTests` is Correctly Composed:**
    - It should merge `MockSparkConfigLayer` and the correctly defined `MockTelemetryLayer` (which itself includes `TelemetryServiceConfigTag`).
    - The existing definition for `dependenciesLayerForLiveTests` and `testLayerForLive` looks fine _after_ the `vi.mock` for telemetry is removed and `MockTelemetryLayer` is correctly providing both `TelemetryService` (Tag) and `TelemetryServiceConfigTag`.

**II. Fix `Effect.service` Usage**

**Target File:** `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`

**Instructions:**

1.  In the test `it('should fail with SparkConfigError if SparkWallet.initialize rejects', ...)`:
    - Change the line:
      ```typescript
      const program = Effect.service(SparkService);
      ```
    - To:
      ```typescript
      const program = Effect.flatMap(SparkService, (s) => Effect.succeed(s));
      ```
    - This pattern correctly resolves the service from the context after the layer (including its acquire/release logic) is built.

**III. Refactor Resource Management Test**

**Target File:** `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`

**Instructions:**

1.  Replace the test `it('should call wallet.cleanupConnections when the service is released', ...)` with the following, which correctly tests the finalizer behavior of a scoped layer:

    ```typescript
    it("should call wallet.cleanupConnections when the service layer scope is closed", async () => {
      cleanupConnectionsMock.mockClear(); // Reset mock from mockSdk.ts
      mockTrackEvent.mockClear(); // Reset telemetry mock

      const testProgram = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        // Using the service here will build its layer within a new scope
        const service = yield* _(SparkService);
        // Perform a dummy operation to ensure the service is used and layer fully initialized
        // Catching potential errors from getBalance as it's not the focus of *this* test
        yield* _(Effect.ignoreLogged(service.getBalance()));
      });

      // Provide SparkServiceLive (which includes the finalizer via Layer.scoped and Effect.addFinalizer)
      // along with its dependencies. Effect.runPromise will create a root scope.
      const runnable = testProgram.pipe(
        Effect.provide(testLayerForLive), // testLayerForLive correctly composes SparkServiceLive with its deps
      );

      // Run the program. When the implicit scope created by runPromise completes,
      // finalizers for layers built within that scope should run.
      await Effect.runPromise(runnable);

      // Check if cleanupConnectionsMock was called
      expect(cleanupConnectionsMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

      // Check telemetry for cleanup success
      expect(mockTrackEvent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        expect.objectContaining({
          category: "spark:dispose",
          action: "wallet_cleanup_success",
        }),
      );
    });
    ```

**IV. Verify `SparkServiceImpl.ts` Finalizer Telemetry**

**Target File:** `src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts`

**Instructions:**

1.  The `Effect.addFinalizer` block's error handling for telemetry needs to be robust.
    - Change the `Effect.catchAllCause` within the finalizer to:
      ```typescript
      Effect.catchAllCause((cause) => {
        // TELEMETRY_IGNORE_THIS_CONSOLE_CALL (This is a last resort log for finalizer failure)
        console.error(
          "[SparkService Finalizer Error] Failed to cleanup wallet or log cleanup failure via telemetry:",
          Cause.pretty(cause),
        );
        // Optionally, try a direct console.log if TelemetryService itself might be unusable
        // console.error("SparkService finalizer failed critically:", Cause.pretty(cause));
        return Effect.void; // Finalizers should generally not fail the overall scope closure.
      });
      ```
    - This ensures that if `releaseTelemetry.trackEvent` fails (e.g., because `TelemetryService` itself is part of the scope being torn down or has issues), the finalizer doesn't throw an unhandled error that masks the original issue or breaks the test runner.

After applying these changes:

1.  Run `pnpm t` to check for TypeScript errors.
2.  Run `pnpm test src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts` to execute the tests.

The "not iterable" error should be resolved due to correct TelemetryService mocking. The `Effect.service` error will be fixed. The resource management test will be more correctly structured. The other failing tests (AssertionErrors) should now proceed further, potentially passing or revealing underlying logic/mock issues that were previously masked by the early "not iterable" failure.Okay, I've reviewed the failing tests and the TypeScript error. The primary issue seems to be related to how `TelemetryService` is being provided or mocked in the context of `SparkServiceLive` tests, leading to the "not iterable" error. The `Effect.service is not a function` error is a specific misuse in one test. The TypeScript error in the resource management test points to a `Scope` requirement not being satisfied.

Here are the specific instructions to fix these issues:

**I. Fix `SparkService.test.ts`**

1.  **Correct `TelemetryService` Mocking and Layer Provision:**

    - At the top of `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`, **REMOVE** the line:
      ```typescript
      // vi.mock('@/services/telemetry', ...); // DELETE THIS LINE if it exists from previous attempts
      ```
    - Ensure your `MockTelemetryLayer` is correctly defined as it was in the previous successful step (agent log `22:00`):

      ```typescript
      // src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts

      // ... other imports ...
      import {
        TelemetryService,
        TelemetryServiceConfigTag,
        TrackEventError,
      } from "@/services/telemetry";
      // ...

      describe("SparkService", () => {
        const mockTrackEvent = vi.fn(() => Effect.succeed(undefined as void));
        const MockTelemetryService = {
          trackEvent: mockTrackEvent,
          isEnabled: () => Effect.succeed(true),
          setEnabled: () => Effect.succeed(undefined as void),
        };

        // Layer for providing TelemetryService and its config
        const MockTelemetryLayer = Layer.provide(
          Layer.succeed(TelemetryService, MockTelemetryService), // Provide the Tag with the mock implementation
          Layer.succeed(TelemetryServiceConfigTag, {
            // Provide the config for the TelemetryService
            enabled: true,
            logToConsole: false,
            logLevel: "info",
          }),
        );

        const mockSparkConfig: SparkServiceConfig = {
          /* ... */
        };
        const MockSparkConfigLayer = Layer.succeed(
          SparkServiceConfigTag,
          mockSparkConfig,
        );

        // Combined dependencies layer for SparkServiceLive tests
        const dependenciesLayerForLiveTests = Layer.merge(
          MockSparkConfigLayer,
          MockTelemetryLayer,
        );
        const testLayerForLive = Layer.provide(
          SparkServiceLive,
          dependenciesLayerForLiveTests,
        );

        // ... rest of the tests ...
      });
      ```

    - This ensures that `TelemetryService` (the Tag) and its `TelemetryServiceConfigTag` are correctly provided by `MockTelemetryLayer`, which is then merged into `dependenciesLayerForLiveTests` and used to provide dependencies to `SparkServiceLive` via `testLayerForLive`. This should resolve the "not iterable" error for `yield* _(TelemetryService);`.

2.  **Fix `Effect.service` Usage in Wallet Initialization Test:**

    - In the test `it('should fail with SparkConfigError if SparkWallet.initialize rejects', ...)`:
    - Change:
      ```typescript
      const program = Effect.service(SparkService);
      ```
    - To:
      ```typescript
      const program = Effect.flatMap(SparkService, (s) => Effect.succeed(s));
      ```

3.  **Fix TypeScript Error in Resource Management Test (`TS2345` - Scope issue):**

    - The test `it('should call wallet.cleanupConnections when the service is released', ...)` uses `Layer.scopedDiscard(SparkServiceLive)` and then tries to provide this layer to `Effect.succeed(undefined)` using `Effect.provideTo`. This is not the standard way to test scoped layers.
    - **Refactor the test:**

      ```typescript
      it("should call wallet.cleanupConnections when the service layer scope is closed", async () => {
        cleanupConnectionsMock.mockClear(); // Reset mock from mockSdk.ts
        mockTrackEvent.mockClear(); // Reset telemetry mock

        const testProgramUsingSparkService = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
          // Accessing SparkService here will ensure its layer (SparkServiceLive) is built
          // within the scope managed by Effect.runPromise.
          const service = yield* _(SparkService);
          // Perform a minimal operation to ensure the service is actually used if needed
          yield* _(Effect.ignoreLogged(service.getBalance()));
        });

        // Provide the testLayerForLive, which correctly sets up SparkServiceLive with its dependencies.
        // SparkServiceLive is Layer.scoped, so its acquire and release will be managed by
        // the implicit scope created by Effect.runPromise.
        const runnableProgram = testProgramUsingSparkService.pipe(
          Effect.provide(testLayerForLive),
        );

        // Run the program. When the scope completes, finalizers should run.
        await Effect.runPromise(runnableProgram);

        // Assert that cleanupConnections was called by the finalizer in SparkServiceLive
        expect(cleanupConnectionsMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
        expect(mockTrackEvent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
          expect.objectContaining({
            category: "spark:dispose",
            action: "wallet_cleanup_success",
          }),
        );
      });
      ```

    - This refactor ensures that `SparkServiceLive` (which is `Layer.scoped`) is properly built and its finalizer (containing `cleanupConnections`) is triggered when the runtime scope for `runnableProgram` is closed. The `R` channel will be `never` after `Effect.provide(testLayerForLive)`.

**II. Verify `SparkServiceImpl.ts` Finalizer (No code change, just conceptual check by agent):**

- The `Effect.addFinalizer` block in `SparkServiceImpl.ts` (added in your previous `22:21` step) should work correctly if `TelemetryService` is properly in context during the finalizer's execution.
  - The line `const releaseTelemetry = yield* _release(TelemetryService);` within the finalizer's `Effect.gen` block is correct for obtaining `TelemetryService` from the finalizer's specific context (`_release`).
  - The `Effect.catchAllCause` for the finalizer should be careful not to assume `TelemetryService` is available if the very act of getting `TelemetryService` failed. It's safer to use a direct `console.error` for critical finalizer logging if telemetry itself might be compromised. The existing:
    ```typescript
    Effect.catchAllCause((cause) =>
      Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, (ts) =>
        ts.trackEvent({
          category: "spark:dispose",
          action: "wallet_cleanup_failure",
          value: Cause.pretty(cause),
        }),
      ),
    );
    ```
    ...might fail if `TelemetryService` cannot be resolved. Change it to a direct console log for the finalizer's error path:
    ```typescript
    Effect.catchAllCause((cause) => {
      // TELEMETRY_IGNORE_THIS_CONSOLE_CALL
      console.error(
        "[SparkService Finalizer Error] Critical failure during cleanup or logging cleanup failure:",
        Cause.pretty(cause),
      );
      return Effect.void; // Finalizers should generally not fail the overall scope closure.
    });
    ```

**III. Re-run Tests:**

- After making the changes in `src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`:
  1.  Execute `pnpm t` to ensure no TypeScript errors.
  2.  Execute `pnpm test src/tests/unit/services/spark/SparkService.test.ts`.

The "not iterable" errors related to `TelemetryService` should now be resolved. The `Effect.service` error should be fixed. The Scope-related TypeScript error in the resource management test should be fixed. The remaining tests that previously failed with `AssertionError: expected false to be true` should now proceed further, and hopefully pass if their underlying logic and SDK mocks are correct.

The issue with `yield* _(TelemetryService)` not being iterable was almost certainly due to `vi.mock` replacing the `TelemetryService` `Effect.Tag` with a plain object. Removing this `vi.mock` and relying on the `Layer.succeed(TelemetryService, MockTelemetryService)` pattern (as seen in `NIP28Service.test.ts` and your own `MockTelemetryLayer`) is the correct fix.
