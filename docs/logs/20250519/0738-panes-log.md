# Panes System Implementation

## Overview
This log documents the implementation of a pane system for the OpenAgents Commander application, following the instructions in `0738-panes-instructions.md` and the design specifications in `docs/panes.md`.

The pane system provides a flexible and dynamic workspace where multiple content windows (panes) can be displayed, moved, resized, and managed by the user. Each pane is an independent unit that can display different types of content, such as chat interfaces, lists of items, or informational displays.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Dependencies Installation
Added the required dependencies to the project:
- zustand (state management)
- @use-gesture/react (handling drag and resize interactions)

```bash
pnpm add zustand @use-gesture/react
```

### 2. Created Core Data Structure
Defined the core data structure in `src/types/pane.ts`:
- `Pane` type with properties for position, size, content type, and state
- `PaneInput` type for creating new panes with optional position/size

### 3. Zustand Store Implementation
Created a robust store structure for managing panes state:
- Directory structure: `src/stores/panes/`
- Types, constants, utilities, and actions in separate files for better organization
- Main store file: `src/stores/pane.ts`
- Implemented persistence using Zustand's persist middleware
- Added actions for:
  - Adding/removing panes
  - Updating position/size
  - Opening chat panes with special logic
  - Bringing panes to front
  - Setting active pane
  - Resetting HUD state

### 4. Core Components
Implemented the following core components:

#### Pane Component (`src/panes/Pane.tsx`)
- Draggable, resizable container for pane content
- Handles mouse interactions for repositioning and resizing
- Manages z-index stacking for overlapping panes
- Provides title bar with close button and optional custom buttons
- Uses the `@use-gesture/react` library for drag and resize handlers

#### PaneManager Component (`src/panes/PaneManager.tsx`)
- Renders and manages all active panes
- Maps pane types to content components
- Provides placeholder content for different pane types

#### SimpleGrid Component (`src/components/home/SimpleGrid.tsx`)
- Creates a grid background for the HUD environment
- Uses SVG for efficient rendering

#### ResetHUDButton Component (`src/components/ResetHUDButton.tsx`)
- Provides a UI control to reset the pane layout to its initial state

### 5. Styling
Added pane-specific styles to `src/styles/global.css`:
- Scrollbar styling for pane content
- Z-index handling for pane stacking
- Utility classes for the resize handles

### 6. Integration with HomePage
Integrated the pane system into `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`:
- Added the PaneManager component
- Added the SimpleGrid background
- Added the ResetHUDButton for resetting the HUD state

## Pane Types
The implemented system supports multiple pane types:
- `chat`: For individual chat interfaces
- `chats`: For listing available chats
- `changelog`: For displaying changelog information
- `diff`: For comparing content differences
- `user`: For user status information
- `default`: Fallback for other types

## Features
The implementation provides the following features:
1. Draggable panes that can be repositioned anywhere in the workspace
2. Resizable panes with handles on all sides and corners
3. Z-index management for overlapping panes
4. Title bars with close buttons and optional custom buttons
5. Type-specific content rendering
6. Persistent state with localStorage
7. Reset button to restore the default layout
8. Grid background for visual context

## Next Steps and Improvements
Potential improvements for the future:
1. Replace placeholder content with actual functional components
2. Add animations for smoother transitions
3. Implement keyboard shortcuts for pane management
4. Add snapping functionality for easier alignment
5. Create more specialized pane types
6. Add context menu options for panes
7. Add minimizing/maximizing functionality

The pane system is now fully integrated and ready for further content development.
