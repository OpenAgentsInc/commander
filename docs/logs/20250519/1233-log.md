# Force Dark Mode Implementation

I've implemented forced dark mode across the application as requested. The changes ensure the application will always use dark mode regardless of system preferences.

## Changes Made

### 1. Renderer Process Theme Helper (`src/helpers/theme_helpers.ts`)

Updated to always force dark mode:

- Modified `getCurrentTheme()` to always return "dark" as the local theme
- Modified `setTheme()` to ignore the requested theme and always set dark mode
- Updated `toggleTheme()` to always maintain dark mode
- Updated `syncThemeWithLocal()` to always set dark mode on startup
- Modified `updateDocumentTheme()` to always add the "dark" class to the HTML element

### 2. Main Process IPC Theme Listeners (`src/helpers/ipc/theme/theme-listeners.ts`)

Modified to ensure Electron's `nativeTheme` is always set to "dark":

- All theme-related IPC handlers now enforce dark mode
- Handlers that previously allowed light or system themes now force dark mode
- `THEME_MODE_CURRENT_CHANNEL` handler now returns "dark" regardless of system theme

### 3. Main Process Initial Setup (`src/main.ts`)

Added early setup to force dark mode on application start:

- Added `nativeTheme` import
- Set `nativeTheme.themeSource = "dark"` at the beginning of the `createWindow()` function

### 4. Theme Toggle UI Component (`src/components/ToggleTheme.tsx`)

Updated to be a non-interactive indicator:

- Removed the functional toggle behavior
- Added styling to make it appear non-interactive
- Added a title attribute to indicate forced dark mode
- Prevented click actions with `e.preventDefault()`

## Results

The application will now:

- Start in dark mode regardless of system preferences
- Maintain dark mode even if the user attempts to change it
- Display a non-interactive dark mode indicator
- Apply dark styling to both web content and native Electron elements
