# SparkService Implementation Refinements

This log documents additional refinements to the SparkService implementation based on instructions in `/docs/logs/20250519/2257-instructions.md`.

## Issue Analysis

Based on the assessment provided in the instructions, while significant progress has been made on the SparkService implementation, there are still a few gaps that need to be addressed:

1. **SDK Response Field Mappings**: The current SDK response field mappings in `SparkServiceImpl.ts` need to be improved for accuracy, especially for `amountSats` and `destination` in `payLightningInvoice`.

2. **Input Schema Validation Tests**: We need to add specific tests that verify the input schema validation failures before SDK calls.

3. **SDK Error Mapping Tests**: We need to expand test coverage for all defined SDK error type mappings across all service methods.

4. **Finalizer Telemetry Robustness**: Ensure the finalizer in `SparkServiceImpl.ts` has robust error handling for its internal telemetry calls.

## Implementation Plan

1. Improve SDK response field mappings in `SparkServiceImpl.ts`
2. Add tests for input schema validation failures in `SparkService.test.ts`
3. Add granular SDK error mapping tests for all error types and service methods
4. Verify finalizer telemetry robustness
