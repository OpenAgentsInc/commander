# Implementation Log for NIP28 Channel Chat Pane

## Overview
This log tracks the implementation of a NIP28 channel chat pane type for the Commander app, including:
- Adding a new pane type to the pane system
- Creating NIP28-specific helpers for Nostr event creation
- Implementing a channel chat hook and component
- Integrating the pane type into the PaneManager
- Adding a "Create NIP28 Channel" action to the pane store

## Implementation Process

I implemented the NIP28 channel chat feature with the following steps:

1. **Updated Pane Types**
   - Added 'nip28_channel' to the pane type union
   - Added channelId and channelName properties to the content object

2. **Created NIP28 Chat UI Components**
   - Modified ChatMessage to support optional author property
   - Created useNostrChannelChat hook for Nostr channel messaging
   - Built Nip28ChannelChat component to render the chat UI

3. **Integrated with PaneManager**
   - Added Nip28ChannelChat component rendering in PaneManager
   - Added a "New Chan" button in the Chats pane title bar

4. **Added Store Actions**
   - Created createNip28ChannelPane action that handles:
     - Creating a new NIP28 channel using the NIP28Service
     - Adding a new pane for the channel
   - Updated PaneStoreType with the new createNip28ChannelPane method
   - Added the action to the pane store implementation

## Final Results

The implementation now provides the following features:

- Users can create new NIP28 channels from the "Chats" pane
- Each channel gets its own pane in the UI system
- Messages are displayed with the author's npub ID
- Users can send messages to the channel
- Messages are displayed in chronological order

The implementation leverages the existing pane system for window management and the existing NostrService and NIP28Service for Nostr message handling.

## Notes

- For demonstration purposes, a static key is used for sending messages
- In a production app, proper key management would be required
- The implementation uses Nostr event subscriptions to stay updated with new messages
- No data persistence is implemented beyond what Nostr relays provide
