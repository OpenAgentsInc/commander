# Implementation Log: Sell Compute Feature

This log documents the implementation of the "Sell Compute" feature, which creates a new UI component for selling compute power through NIP-90 Data Vending Machine functionality.

## Overview

The implementation involves several major components:

1. Creating a new Hotbar UI to replace individual HUD buttons
2. Adding a "Sell Compute" pane type and its associated UI components
3. Implementing status checks for Spark wallet and Ollama
4. Adding the `Kind5050DVMService` that will handle the actual DVM operations

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Creating the Hotbar UI Components

- Created `HotbarItem.tsx` and `Hotbar.tsx` components to replace the individual HUD buttons
- Updated `HomePage.tsx` to use the new Hotbar component
- Added slot numbers and improved styling for the HUD elements

### 2. Adding the "Sell Compute" Pane Type

- Added 'sell_compute' type to `Pane` in `src/types/pane.ts`
- Created `openSellComputePane` action in the store
- Updated `PaneManager.tsx` to handle the new pane type

### 3. Implementing the "Sell Compute" UI

- Created `SellComputePane.tsx` component with status indicators and "Go Online/Offline" button
- Added `checkWalletStatus` method to `SparkService`
- Added `checkOllamaStatus` method to `OllamaService`

### 4. Creating the Kind5050DVMService

- Created interface definition in `Kind5050DVMService.ts` with methods for:
  - `startListening()`: Begin listening for job requests
  - `stopListening()`: Stop listening for job requests
  - `isListening()`: Check current listening status
- Implemented a stub version in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts` that logs actions but doesn't yet process real jobs
- Added the service to `runtime.ts`, with dependencies on NostrService, OllamaService, SparkService, and TelemetryService
- Connected the SellComputePane UI to the DVM service actions

## Architecture and Design Decisions

- The Hotbar provides a more organized and consistent UI for HUD elements
- The Sell Compute pane checks both Spark and Ollama status before allowing the user to go online
- The Kind5050DVMService is designed as an Effect service with proper error handling
- All operations are properly typed with Effect.Effect return types and descriptive error types
- We use telemetry extensively to track service operations for future debugging

## Next Steps

Future work should include:

- Full implementation of NIP-90 Kind 5050 job request handling in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts`
- Implementation of invoice creation via `SparkService` for compute jobs
- Integration with `OllamaService` for actual inference
- Comprehensive UI for displaying DVM activity and job history

## Current Status

The UI components are fully implemented and the service architecture is in place:

- A new Hotbar with existing HUD buttons plus the new "Sell Compute" button
- Sell Compute pane with status indicators for Spark and Ollama
- Go Online/Offline button connected to Kind5050DVMService
- Stub implementation of Kind5050DVMService that logs actions but doesn't yet process real jobs

The next phase would be implementing the full NIP-90 DVM logic to handle actual compute jobs.
