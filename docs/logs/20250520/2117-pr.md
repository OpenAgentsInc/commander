# OpenAgents Commander: Implement DVM Service with Payment Handling & UI Improvements

## Summary
This PR delivers a comprehensive implementation of the Data Vending Machine (DVM) service with payment processing capabilities and several UI improvements:

- Implemented full DVM service with Effect.js for selling compute resources via NIP-90
- Added SparkService integration for Lightning payment processing and verification
- Created DVM Job History UI for tracking compute jobs and payments
- Fixed Layer object access bugs in DVM settings components
- Improved homepage layout with optimized pane positioning
- Added better persistence handling for UI state

## Implementation Details

### DVM Service Implementation
- Implemented `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl` with core functionality for handling compute jobs
- Added data structures for managing job history, status tracking, and statistics
- Integrated with SparkService for generating and verifying Lightning invoices
- Set up background processing for payment status verification
- Added telemetry tracking throughout the DVM workflow

### Lightning Payment Integration
- Enhanced SparkService with `checkInvoiceStatus` functionality
- Added data structures for tracking invoices in job history
- Implemented background fiber for continuous payment status monitoring
- Added error handling and telemetry for payment processing

### UI Components
- Created DVM Job History pane with statistics dashboard and job list
- Added Hotbar icon for quick access to job history
- Implemented persistent storage for pane states

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed frontend crash in DVM settings by properly exporting configuration objects
- Eliminated unsafe Layer property access in store and component code
- Improved type safety throughout the codebase

### UI Improvements
- Redesigned homepage layout with Sell Compute pane as the primary focus
- Optimized Welcome Chat position and sizing for better UX
- Enhanced pane z-index management to properly layer UI elements
- Added better persistence with safer fallbacks for corrupted state

## Testing
- All TypeScript type checks pass
- Unit tests updated and passing for new services
- Manually verified UI components and interactions

## Next Steps
- Implement storage layer for DVM job history
- Add payment receipt functionality
- Expand job types beyond text generation
