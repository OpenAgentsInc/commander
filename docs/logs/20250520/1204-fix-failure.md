# Fix for CI Test Failure

The CI pipeline is failing with:

```
FAIL  src/tests/unit/services/nip90/NIP90Service.test.ts > NIP90Service > createJobRequest > should handle validation errors
AssertionError: expected (FiberFailure) NIP90ValidationError: Invaâ€¦ to be an instance of NIP90ValidationError
```

This is because there seems to be an inconsistency between our local environment and the CI environment in how Effect.js wraps errors. The CI error message shows that our local fix for handling the error as a string didn't get properly applied or didn't get pushed to GitHub.

## Fix Approach

We need to update the test file to explicitly handle FiberFailure wrapping in a way that works consistently in both local and CI environments. Here's how to fix it:

1. Open the file `src/tests/unit/services/nip90/NIP90Service.test.ts`

2. Locate the problematic test around line 133 (`it("should handle validation errors"...`)

3. Replace the entire try/catch block with this code:

```typescript
try {
  await Effect.runPromise(runEffectTest(program));
  expect.fail("Should have thrown error");
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Just verify that we got a thrown error containing our error message
  // The exact error structure will depend on how Effect wraps the errors
  const errorString = String(e);
  expect(errorString).toContain("Invalid NIP-90 job request parameters");
  expect(errorString).toContain("NIP90ValidationError");
}
```

4. Commit this change with a message like "Fix test for CI: handle FiberFailure error wrapping consistently"

This approach abandons trying to use `instanceof` checks (which are fragile when dealing with Effect.js error wrapping) and instead focuses on verifying the error message string contents, which is more reliable across environments.

If this issue persists, we may need to look at how Effect.js is handling errors in the CI environment versus locally, but this string-based approach should be resilient to those differences.
