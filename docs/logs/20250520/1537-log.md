# Implementation Log - Adjusting Homepage Pane Layout

## Overview

I've implemented the changes to adjust the homepage layout to make the "Sell Compute" pane the main focus initially, with the "Welcome Chat" (default NIP-28 channel pane) smaller, positioned in the bottom-left, and visually "behind" the Sell Compute pane.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Constants for Pane Sizes and Positions

**File:** `src/stores/panes/constants.ts`

Added several new constants to manage initial sizes, including:

```typescript
// Constants for default NIP-28 "Welcome Chat" pane
export const WELCOME_CHAT_INITIAL_WIDTH = 350;
export const WELCOME_CHAT_INITIAL_HEIGHT = 250;

// Constants for "Sell Compute" pane
export const SELL_COMPUTE_PANE_ID_CONST = 'sell_compute';
export const SELL_COMPUTE_INITIAL_WIDTH = 550;
export const SELL_COMPUTE_INITIAL_HEIGHT = 420;

// Approximate height of the Hotbar for positioning calculations
export const HOTBAR_APPROX_HEIGHT = 60; // pixels
```

### 2. Modified Initial Pane Configuration in the Store

**File:** `src/stores/pane.ts`

Updated the `getInitialPanes()` function to:

1. Create the "Welcome Chat" pane with these properties:
   - Positioned in bottom-left corner (accounting for Hotbar height)
   - Made smaller (350×250)
   - Set `isActive: false` to keep it inactive by default
   - Set `dismissable: true` to allow users to close it

2. Added the "Sell Compute" pane with these properties:
   - Positioned centrally, slightly higher than center
   - Made larger (550×420)
   - Set `isActive: true` to make it active by default
   - The pane ordering ensures "Sell Compute" renders on top

3. Updated `initialState` to set `activePaneId: SELL_COMPUTE_PANE_ID_CONST`

4. Updated `lastPanePosition` to reflect the Sell Compute pane's position

5. Updated the `resetHUDState` function to reset to the new layout

6. Enhanced the `merge` function to:
   - Reset to defaults if Sell Compute pane is missing
   - Ensure the Welcome Chat pane exists with correct positioning
   - Make sure Sell Compute is rendered on top when active

### 3. HomePage.tsx Adjustments

**File:** `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`

The instructions mentioned removing a useEffect that automatically opened the Sell Compute pane, but upon inspection, this code was not present in the current implementation. The pane initialization is now handled entirely through the store's initial state.

## Implementation Details

### Order of Panes and Z-Index Handling

The order of panes in the array determines their z-index stacking:
- "Welcome Chat" is added first (index 0)
- "Sell Compute" is added second (index 1)

This ensures "Sell Compute" renders on top by default. Additionally, the `merge` function ensures that if "Sell Compute" is the active pane, it's moved to the end of the array to maintain proper z-index stacking.

### Positioning Logic

For the bottom-left positioning of the Welcome Chat pane:
```typescript
y: screenHeight - WELCOME_CHAT_INITIAL_HEIGHT - PANE_MARGIN - HOTBAR_APPROX_HEIGHT
```

This calculation ensures the pane sits above the Hotbar with proper margin spacing.

For the central positioning of the Sell Compute pane:
```typescript
x: Math.max(PANE_MARGIN, (screenWidth - SELL_COMPUTE_INITIAL_WIDTH) / 2),
y: Math.max(PANE_MARGIN, (screenHeight - SELL_COMPUTE_INITIAL_HEIGHT) / 3)
```

The `/3` in the y-position calculation places it slightly higher than center for better visual balance.

## Testing

The changes initialize the panes with the correct hierarchy and positioning on initial load. The store's persistence logic has been enhanced to maintain this configuration across sessions and handle various edge cases like missing panes.
