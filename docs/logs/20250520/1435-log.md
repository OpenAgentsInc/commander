# DVM Job History & Statistics UI Implementation

This log documents the implementation of a UI for displaying job history and statistics for the Selling Compute feature.

## Overview

This task involves creating a new pane that shows an overview of DVM activity, earnings, and a list of past jobs. The implementation includes:

1. Defining data structures for job history and statistics
2. Adding new methods to the `Kind5050DVMService` interface with stub implementations
3. Creating a new pane type and store actions
4. Adding a button to the Hotbar
5. Building the DvmJobHistoryPane component
6. Integrating the component into the PaneManager

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Created Data Structures for Job History and Statistics

Created the file `src/types/dvm.ts` with the following interfaces:

- `JobStatus`: Enum type for job processing states
- `JobHistoryEntry`: Interface for individual job history entries
- `JobStatistics`: Interface for aggregated job statistics

The data structures include fields for tracking job requests, payments, and processing details.

### 2. Updated Kind5050DVMService Interface

Updated `src/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMService.ts` to:

1. Import the new types from `@/types/dvm`
2. Add two new methods to the interface:
   - `getJobHistory`: Retrieves paginated job history entries with optional filtering
   - `getJobStatistics`: Retrieves aggregated statistics about processed jobs and revenue

These methods are designed to work with the Effect.js pattern already used throughout the codebase, following the same error handling approach.

### 3. Implemented Stub Methods in Kind5050DVMServiceImpl

Updated `src/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts` to:

1. Import the necessary types from `@/types/dvm`
2. Implement stub versions of the new methods:
   - `getJobHistory`: Returns mock job history data with support for pagination and filtering
   - `getJobStatistics`: Returns mock statistics data

Both methods include telemetry tracking and follow the same Effect.js pattern used throughout the service implementation. They currently return static mock data, which will be replaced with actual persistence logic in a future task.

### 4. Updated Pane Types and Created Store Actions

Created the store actions for the DVM Job History pane:

1. Added 'dvm_job_history' to the pane type union in `src/types/pane.ts`
2. Created `src/stores/panes/actions/openDvmJobHistoryPane.ts` with logic for opening/activating the pane
3. Added the new action to the actions index file
4. Updated the `PaneStoreType` interface to include the new action
5. Updated the pane store to wire up the new action

This allows the DVM Job History pane to be opened, closed, and managed like other panes in the system.

### 5. Added DVM Job History Button to Hotbar

Updated the Hotbar component to include the DVM Job History button:

1. Added the History icon from Lucide React
2. Added a new prop to the `HotbarProps` interface
3. Updated the Hotbar component to render the new button in slot 6
4. Updated the HomePage component to pass the openDvmJobHistoryPane action to the Hotbar

The button is properly integrated with the existing UI, and its active state is tied to whether the job history pane is the currently active pane.

### 6. Created DvmJobHistoryPane Component

Created a new component at `src/components/dvm/DvmJobHistoryPane.tsx`:

1. Added shadcn/ui Table component using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add table`
2. Implemented the DvmJobHistoryPane component with the following features:
   - Dashboard-style statistics cards showing job totals, success/failure counts, and revenue
   - Tabular job history with pagination
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Refresh functionality to update the data
   - Visual indicators for different job statuses

This component uses React Query to fetch data from the DVM service and to handle loading, error states, and data refetching.

### 7. Integrated DvmJobHistoryPane into PaneManager

Updated `src/panes/PaneManager.tsx` to:

1. Import the DvmJobHistoryPane component
2. Add a case to render the DvmJobHistoryPane when the pane type is 'dvm_job_history'
3. Update the fallback check to include the new pane type

With this integration, the DVM Job History pane can now be opened from the Hotbar and will display job history and statistics using data from the Kind5050DVMService.
