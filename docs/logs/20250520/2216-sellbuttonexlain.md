When you click "GO ONLINE" in the "Sell Compute" pane of the OpenAgents Commander application, a series of actions are initiated to make your local compute resources available as a Nostr NIP-90 Data Vending Machine (DVM).

Here's a breakdown of what happens, based on the provided documentation:

1.  **UI Interaction and Pre-checks (`SellComputePane.tsx`):**
    *   The button's `onClick` handler (`handleGoOnlineToggle`) is triggered.
    *   The UI will likely show a loading state (`isDvmLoading` set to `true`) on the button to indicate that the DVM is starting up.
    *   There's a check to ensure your Spark wallet and Ollama instance are connected. If they are not, and you're not already online, an alert might appear, and the process might not proceed.

2.  **DVM Service Activation (`Kind5050DVMService.startListening()`):**
    *   The UI handler calls the `startListening()` method on the `Kind5050DVMService`. This is the core action to bring your DVM online.
    *   **Configuration Loading:**
        *   The service retrieves its effective configuration. This configuration is a combination of default settings and any user-specific settings saved via the DVMSettingsDialog (gear icon in SellComputePane). These user settings are persisted in `localStorage` using `dvmSettingsStore.ts`.
        *   The configuration includes:
            *   Your DVM's Nostr private and public keys (either default generated or user-provided).
            *   The list of Nostr relays your DVM will monitor for job requests.
            *   The NIP-90 job kinds your DVM supports (e.g., `5100` for text generation).
            *   Default text generation parameters (model, max_tokens, temperature, etc.).
            *   Pricing parameters (minimum price, price per 1k tokens).
    *   **Nostr Subscription:**
        *   The `Kind5050DVMService` uses the `NostrService` to connect to the configured Nostr relays.
        *   It subscribes to NIP-90 job request events (kinds `5000-5999`, specifically the ones listed in `supportedJobKinds` from your configuration, e.g., `5100`).
        *   The subscription uses the relays specified in your DVM settings, not necessarily the NostrService's default relays.
        *   A handler (`processJobRequestInternal`) is set up to process incoming job request events.
    *   **Payment Verification Process Initiation:**
        *   A background task (an Effect.js fiber) is started. This task will run periodically (every 2 minutes, as per `docs/SELLING_COMPUTE.md`) to check the status of any pending payments for jobs that have been processed and invoiced. It does this by calling `SparkService.checkInvoiceStatus()`.
    *   **Internal State Update:**
        *   The DVM service updates its internal state to indicate it is now active and listening (e.g., an `isActiveInternal` flag is set to `true`).
    *   **Telemetry:**
        *   Events related to starting the DVM service, successful subscription, or any errors encountered are logged via the `TelemetryService`.

3.  **UI Update Post-Activation (`SellComputePane.tsx`):**
    *   After the `startListening()` effect completes (or if it fails):
        *   The DVM service's actual listening status is re-checked (e.g., by calling `Kind5050DVMService.isListening()` via a `checkDVMStatus()` function in the UI).
        *   The `isOnline` state in the UI is updated based on this actual status.
        *   The loading state on the button (`isDvmLoading`) is set to `false`.
        *   The button text changes from "GO ONLINE" to "GO OFFLINE".
        *   The button's appearance (e.g., icon from `Zap` to `ZapOff`) changes.

4.  **While Online (Ongoing Operations):**
    *   **Listening for Job Requests:** Your DVM continuously listens for Nostr events matching your subscribed filters on the configured relays.
    *   **Job Processing (handled by `processJobRequestInternal` for each incoming job):**
        *   Validates incoming job request parameters.
        *   If the request is NIP-04 encrypted, it decrypts it using your DVM's private key and the requester's public key.
        *   Sends a "processing" status update (kind 7000) back to the requester via Nostr.
        *   Uses `OllamaService` to perform the AI inference (e.g., text generation) based on the job's prompt and parameters.
        *   Calculates the job price based on token count and your DVM's pricing settings.
        *   Uses `SparkService` to generate a Lightning invoice for the calculated amount.
        *   Stores the BOLT11 invoice and payment hash (likely in an in-memory job history, as persistent job history is noted as "Remaining Work").
        *   Sends the job result (kind 6xxx, e.g., 6100), including the Lightning invoice, back to the requester. If the original request was encrypted, the result is also NIP-04 encrypted.
        *   Sends a "success" status update (kind 7000) back to the requester.
        *   The job status is initially set to "pending_payment".
        *   Each job request is processed in its own Effect.js fiber, allowing for concurrent processing.
    *   **Automatic Payment Verification (Ongoing):**
        *   The background fiber periodically (every 2 minutes) checks jobs marked "pending_payment".
        *   For each such job, it calls `SparkService.checkInvoiceStatus()` with the stored invoice.
        *   If an invoice is paid, the job status is updated to "paid", and the payment amount is recorded. This status change would be reflected in the DVM Job History pane.

In summary, clicking "GO ONLINE" configures and activates your local system as a Nostr-based Data Vending Machine. It subscribes to job requests, sets up background payment verification, and prepares to process AI tasks using Ollama and handle payments with Spark, all orchestrated by the `Kind5050DVMService`. All significant events and errors are logged via the `TelemetryService`.
