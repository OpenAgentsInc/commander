# NIP-90 Service Implementation Log

This log documents the implementation of the NIP-90 Data Vending Machine (DVM) service layer and UI pane integration.

## Tasks

1. Create the NIP-90 service architecture
2. Implement the service logic
3. Integrate with the application runtime
4. Create the UI components
5. Update the pane system
6. Test the implementation

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Service Structure and Interface

Created the directory structure for the NIP-90 service:

```
src/services/nip90/
├── NIP90Service.ts
├── NIP90ServiceImpl.ts
└── index.ts
```

In `NIP90Service.ts`:

- Defined error types including `NIP90ServiceError`, `NIP90RequestError`, `NIP90ResultError`, and `NIP90ValidationError`
- Created schemas for NIP-90 data structures:
  - `NIP90InputTypeSchema` for input types (url, event, job, text)
  - `NIP90InputSchema` for input format [data, type, relay?, marker?]
  - `NIP90JobParamSchema` for additional parameters ['param', key, value]
  - `CreateNIP90JobParamsSchema` for job request parameters
  - `NIP90JobResultSchema` for job results (kind 6xxx)
  - `NIP90JobFeedbackStatusSchema` for feedback status values
  - `NIP90JobFeedbackSchema` for job feedback (kind 7000)
- Defined the `NIP90Service` interface with methods:
  - `createJobRequest`: For creating and publishing job requests
  - `getJobResult`: For fetching job results
  - `listJobFeedback`: For listing feedback events
  - `subscribeToJobUpdates`: For subscribing to job updates in real-time

### Phase 2: Service Implementation

In `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts`:

- Implemented the service methods using Effect for functional error handling
- Used existing helpers from `src/helpers/nip90/event_creation.ts` for job request creation
- Integrated with `NostrService` for publishing and fetching events
- Added decryption support using `NIP04Service`
- Added telemetry for all operations

In `index.ts`:

- Re-exported service interface and implementation

### Phase 3: Runtime Integration

In `src/services/runtime.ts`:

- Added `NIP90Service` to the `FullAppContext` type
- Created a `nip90Layer` with dependencies on `NostrService`, `NIP04Service`, and `TelemetryService`
- Added the layer to the `FullAppLayer` composition

### Phase 4: UI Integration

Updated pane types:

- Added `'nip90_dashboard'` to the pane type union in `src/types/pane.ts`

Created the dashboard component:

- Implemented `Nip90Dashboard.tsx` that combines the request form and event list
- Updated `PaneManager.tsx` to render the dashboard for panes with type `'nip90_dashboard'`

Added pane actions:

- Created `openNip90DashboardPane.ts` action to open or focus the dashboard
- Updated pane store types and exports

Added UI button:

- Implemented `Nip90DashboardButton.tsx` for the HUD
- Added the button to `HomePage.tsx`

### Phase 5: Adapting Existing Components

Modified existing components to use the new service:

- Updated `Nip90RequestForm.tsx` to use `NIP90Service.createJobRequest`
- Updated `Nip90EventList.tsx` to use `NIP90Service` for fetching requests, results and feedback
- Enhanced UI to display job results and feedback when available

### Phase 6: Testing

Created test file:

- Added tests in `src/tests/unit/services/nip90/NIP90Service.test.ts`
- Tested all service methods with mocked dependencies
- Verified error handling for various scenarios

Fixed schema issues encountered during testing:

- Updated Schema.Array/Schema.array usage in schemas
- Fixed error handling in service implementation

## Summary

Completed the NIP-90 service implementation with a full UI integration. The service provides a clean interface for creating job requests, fetching results, and managing feedback events, all with proper error handling through Effect. The UI components allow users to interact with NIP-90 Data Vending Machines through a dedicated dashboard pane.

All components use the mainRuntime to access the NIP90Service, ensuring a consistent dependency injection approach throughout the application.
