# NIP90 TypeScript Error Fixes

## Summary of Issues

The main TypeScript error was related to Effect's context typing (`R` channel) in the NIP90Service implementation. The core issue was that methods in the NIP90Service interface were not correctly declaring `R = never` once dependencies are provided, which caused type mismatches in the test files.

## Approach

1. Modified the `NIP90Service` interface to specify `R = never` for all methods
2. Updated the implementation in `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` to ensure that all helper functions have their required services properly provided
3. Fixed the test file to handle error cases properly

## Changes Made

### Step 1: Updated NIP90Service.ts interface with R = never

Changed the return type of all methods in the NIP90Service interface to use `R = never`:

```typescript
export interface NIP90Service {
  createJobRequest(
    params: CreateNIP90JobParams,
  ): Effect.Effect<
    NostrEvent,
    | NIP90RequestError
    | NIP04EncryptError
    | NostrPublishError
    | NIP90ValidationError,
    never
  >;

  getJobResult(
    jobRequestEventId: string,
    dvmPubkeyHex?: string,
    decryptionKey?: Uint8Array,
  ): Effect.Effect<
    NIP90JobResult | null,
    NIP90ResultError | NIP04DecryptError | NostrRequestError,
    never
  >;

  // ... other methods similarly changed to use R = never
}
```

### Step 2: Modified NIP90ServiceImpl.ts to provide services to helper functions

The key issue was that `createNip90JobRequest` from `helpers/nip90/event_creation.ts` needed the `NIP04Service` to be provided. Updated the implementation to inject the service:

```typescript
// Before:
const jobEvent =
  yield *
  _(
    createNip90JobRequest(
      validatedParams.requesterSk,
      validatedParams.targetDvmPubkeyHex || "",
      mutableInputs,
      validatedParams.outputMimeType || "text/plain",
      validatedParams.bidMillisats,
      validatedParams.kind,
      mutableAdditionalParams,
    ),
  );

// After:
// Create the effect for the job request creation
const jobEventEffect = createNip90JobRequest(
  validatedParams.requesterSk,
  validatedParams.targetDvmPubkeyHex || "",
  mutableInputs,
  validatedParams.outputMimeType || "text/plain",
  validatedParams.bidMillisats,
  validatedParams.kind,
  mutableAdditionalParams,
);

// Provide NIP04Service from the closure
const jobEventWithServiceProvided = Effect.provideService(
  jobEventEffect,
  NIP04Service,
  nip04,
);

// Now yield the effect that has the service provided
const jobEvent = yield * _(jobEventWithServiceProvided);
```

### Step 3: Fixed the NIP90Service.test.ts file

Updated the error handling in the tests to work with the way Effect wraps errors in FiberFailure:

```typescript
try {
  await Effect.runPromise(runEffectTest(program));
  expect.fail("Should have thrown error");
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Just verify that we got a thrown error containing our error message
  // The exact error structure will depend on how Effect wraps the errors
  const errorString = String(e);
  expect(errorString).toContain("Invalid NIP-90 job request parameters");
  expect(errorString).toContain("NIP90ValidationError");
}
```

## Results

All TypeScript errors have been fixed, and all tests are now passing. The changes maintain the same functionality while correctly modeling the dependency injection in Effect:

1. Service interfaces declare methods with `R = never` indicating that once an instance is provided, no further dependencies are needed
2. Service implementations handle their internal dependencies by capturing service instances in closures and providing them to helpers as needed
3. Test code correctly handles error propagation

The key insight was understanding that once a service instance is created (with all its dependencies satisfied), its methods should not impose additional context requirements on callers. This is achieved by setting `R = never` in interface method signatures and ensuring implementation details handle dependencies correctly.
