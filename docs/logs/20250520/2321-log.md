# TypeScript Error Fixes - 2321

I'm going to fix TypeScript errors in the codebase as instructed in `docs/logs/20250520/2321-instructions.md`.

## Issue Analysis

There are two files with TypeScript errors:

1. `src/components/nip90_dvm_test/Nip90DvmTestPane.tsx`

   - The error occurs when trying to access `error.message` on a value of type `unknown`
   - Need to implement proper type checking before accessing the message property

2. `src/tests/unit/stores/paneActions.test.ts`
   - Several issues:
     - `vi.mock` calls with incorrect arguments (3 args where only 1-2 expected)
     - `mockStore.panes` is typed as `never[]`
     - `mockStore.activePaneId` is typed as `null`
     - Need to properly type the mock store

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix error handling in `Nip90DvmTestPane.tsx`
2. Fix `vi.mock` calls in `paneActions.test.ts`
3. Add proper type definitions for `mockStore` in `paneActions.test.ts`
4. Run tests to verify fixes

## Implementation

### 1. Fixed error handling in Nip90DvmTestPane.tsx

The issue was in the error handling code where we were directly accessing `error.message` on a value of type `unknown`. This is a type safety issue because TypeScript doesn't know if the `unknown` value has a `message` property.

Changed from:

```typescript
if (Exit.isSuccess(exit)) {
  setTestJobResult(exit.value);
} else {
  const error = Cause.squash(exit.cause);
  setTestJobError(error.message || "Unknown error processing test job.");
  console.error("Test job error:", error);
}
```

To:

```typescript
if (Exit.isSuccess(exit)) {
  setTestJobResult(exit.value);
} else {
  const error = Cause.squash(exit.cause);
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    setTestJobError(error.message || "Unknown error processing test job.");
  } else if (typeof error === "string") {
    setTestJobError(error || "Unknown error processing test job.");
  } else if (
    error &&
    typeof error === "object" &&
    "message" in error &&
    typeof error.message === "string"
  ) {
    setTestJobError(error.message || "Unknown error processing test job.");
  } else {
    setTestJobError("An unknown error occurred processing the test job.");
  }
  console.error("Test job error:", error);
}
```

The improved code properly checks the type of the error before trying to access its properties:

1. First checks if it's an instance of Error
2. Then checks if it's a string
3. Then checks if it's an object with a message property
4. Falls back to a generic error message if none of the above

### 2. Fixed vi.mock calls in paneActions.test.ts

The issue was with the third argument `{ virtual: true }` being passed to the `vi.mock` calls, which is not accepted in this version of Vitest.

Changed from:

```typescript
vi.mock("@buildonspark/lrc20-sdk", () => ({}), { virtual: true });
vi.mock("bitcoinjs-lib", () => ({}), { virtual: true });
vi.mock("nostr-tools", () => ({}), { virtual: true });
```

To:

```typescript
vi.mock("@buildonspark/lrc20-sdk", () => ({}));
vi.mock("bitcoinjs-lib", () => ({}));
vi.mock("nostr-tools", () => ({}));
```

### 3. Added proper type definitions for mockStore in paneActions.test.ts

The issue was that `mockStore.panes` was implicitly typed as `never[]` and `mockStore.activePaneId` as `null`, causing type errors when trying to work with these properties.

Changes:

1. Added an import for the `Pane` type:

   ```typescript
   import { type Pane } from "@/types/pane";
   ```

2. Created a `MockStoreType` interface:

   ```typescript
   interface MockStoreType {
     panes: Pane[];
     activePaneId: string | null;
     lastPanePosition: {
       x: number;
       y: number;
       width: number;
       height: number;
     } | null;
     resetHUDState: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;
     openNip90DvmTestPane: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;
     openNip90ConsumerChatPane: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;
   }
   ```

3. Applied the type to the `mockStore` object:

   ```typescript
   const mockStore: MockStoreType = {
     // ... properties with proper types
   };
   ```

4. Added empty `content` objects to the pane objects to satisfy the Pane type:
   ```typescript
   mockStore.panes.push({
     // ...
     content: {}, // Add empty content object to satisfy type
   });
   ```

These changes ensure that TypeScript correctly understands the types of the mock store's properties and methods, preventing type errors when working with them.

## Verification

After implementing all the changes, I ran the TypeScript type check:

```
pnpm run t
```

The compilation completed successfully with no errors, confirming that our fixes have resolved all the TypeScript type issues.

## Summary

In this task, I fixed two files with TypeScript errors:

1. In `Nip90DvmTestPane.tsx`, I properly handled the `unknown` type error by adding type guards before accessing the `message` property of the error object.

2. In `paneActions.test.ts`, I addressed multiple issues:
   - Removed the unsupported third argument from `vi.mock` calls
   - Added proper type definitions for the mock store
   - Properly typed the `panes` array and `activePaneId` properties
   - Added empty `content` objects to the mock pane objects to satisfy the type requirements

All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the codebase now passes type checking.
