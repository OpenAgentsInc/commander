# Pull Request: Fix NIP-04 Encryption in NIP-90 Consumer Chat

## Summary

This PR fixes a critical issue with NIP-04 encryption in the NIP-90 consumer chat pane. The fix ensures that encryption only proceeds with valid keys and that the component can handle cases where encryption is not possible or desired, such as when broadcasting a job request without a specific DVM target.

## Changes

- Enhanced key validation and error handling in the NIP-90 consumer chat hook
- Added proper separation between encryption keys and p-tag keys
- Improved error messages and telemetry for encryption failures
- Updated UI labels and placeholders to better guide users
- Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues with nostr-tools API
- Made encryption truly optional in the job request creation helper

## Testing

- TypeScript checks pass (`pnpm run t`)
- All unit tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- Manually verified encryption and unencrypted broadcasts work correctly
- Tests for the NIP-90 consumer chat components remain skipped (as they were before)

## Impact

These changes make the NIP-90 job request process more robust and flexible, allowing users to:

1. Send encrypted requests to specific DVMs (using valid npub or hex keys)
2. Broadcast unencrypted requests to any DVM
3. Receive better error messages when key validation fails

## Technical Notes

The core of the fix involves separating the concept of "target DVM for encryption" from "target DVM for p-tag routing" in the NIP-90 job request creation process, ensuring that encryption only occurs when valid keys are provided.
