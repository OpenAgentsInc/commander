# Fix for IPC Registration Timing Issue

## Problem

The application was encountering the following error:

```
SellComputePane.tsx:46 Ollama status check failed: Error: Error invoking remote method 'ollama:status-check': Error: No handler registered for 'ollama:status-check'
```

This error indicates that when the renderer process (specifically `SellComputePane.tsx`) tried to invoke the `'ollama:status-check'` IPC method, the main process didn't have a corresponding handler registered for that channel.

## Root Cause

The issue is related to **timing** in the Electron application lifecycle:

1. The `ollamaServiceLayer` was properly moved inside the `addOllamaEventListeners` function in the previous fix
2. However, the IPC event listeners were still being registered too late in the Electron lifecycle
3. The renderer process was trying to use the IPC channels before they were registered in the main process

## Comprehensive Solution

We implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure the IPC handlers are properly registered and available when needed:

### 1. Early Registration in Main Process

1. Modified `main.ts` to:

   - Import `addOllamaEventListeners` directly
   - Call `addOllamaEventListeners()` at the module level (before `createWindow()`)
   - Add detailed logging for debugging

2. Updated `listeners-register.ts` to:
   - Remove the call to `addOllamaEventListeners()`
   - Add comments explaining that Ollama listeners are registered earlier in `main.ts`
   - Add logging to clarify what's happening

### 2. Prevent Double Registration

Modified `ollama-listeners.ts` to:

- Add a global flag `__ollamaEventListenersRegistered` to track if listeners have already been registered
- Check this flag before attempting to register listeners again
- Add enhanced error handling with more detailed logging

### 3. Improved Error Handling

Enhanced error handling in `ollama-listeners.ts`:

- Added a fallback service layer if the primary layer initialization fails
- Added a last-resort emergency fallback handler for the status check
- Added detailed error logging with stack traces
- Made the code more resilient to initialization failures

### 4. Client-Side Mitigations

Modified the SellComputePane component to:

- Add a 1-second delay before checking Ollama status to ensure IPC handlers are registered
- Add a fallback mechanism to try direct API access if IPC fails
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add defensive checks before trying to use IPC methods

## How It Works

1. **Early Registration**: The IPC handlers are registered as early as possible in the application lifecycle
2. **Delayed Invocation**: The renderer waits a moment before trying to use the handlers
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If IPC fails, try alternative approaches
4. **Defensive Coding**: Check if methods exist before trying to use them
5. **Detailed Logging**: Provide clear information about what's happening at each step

## Expected Results

This comprehensive approach should resolve the "No handler registered" error by ensuring:

1. The handlers are registered before the renderer needs them
2. There are fallbacks in place if registration fails
3. The renderer process has mechanisms to handle IPC failures gracefully

**Note**: A complete restart of the Electron application is required for these changes to take effect.

## Follow-up TypeScript Fixes

After resolving the IPC registration timing issue, we encountered and fixed two TypeScript errors:

1. **Incorrect Error Type in Fallback Service:**

   - The fallback implementation of `generateChatCompletion` was returning a generic `Error` object
   - Changed to return properly typed `OllamaHttpError` objects to match the interface requirements

2. **Improper Use of `Cause.pretty()`:**
   - `Cause.pretty()` was being called with a non-Cause type object
   - Implemented custom error message formatting for these objects

See the [TypeScript fixes log](./2204-typescript-fixes.md) for detailed information about these changes.
