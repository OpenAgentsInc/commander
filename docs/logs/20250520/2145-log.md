# CORS Fix for Ollama API Connection

## Problem

After updating the Content Security Policy to allow connections to the Ollama API server running at `http://localhost:11434`, we encountered a CORS preflight error:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:11434/' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field traceparent is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
```

This indicated that the `traceparent` header, automatically added by the `@effect/platform/HttpClient` for distributed tracing, was not allowed by the Ollama server's CORS policy.

## Analysis

The issue is occurring because:

1. Our application (running on `http://localhost:5173`) is trying to send a request to the Ollama server (`http://localhost:11434`).
2. The Effect HTTP client automatically adds a `traceparent` header for distributed tracing.
3. When the browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request to check if this non-standard header is allowed, the Ollama server doesn't include `traceparent` in its `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response.
4. As a result, the browser blocks the actual request due to CORS policy.

## Solution

Since we can't modify the Ollama server's CORS configuration, we need to prevent our client from sending the `traceparent` header. The `@effect/platform/HttpClient` provides a way to disable tracer propagation.

I implemented the following changes in `src/services/ollama/OllamaServiceImpl.ts`:

1. In the `OllamaServiceLive` layer definition, created a modified HTTP client with tracer propagation disabled:

```typescript
// Import the module for utility functions
import * as HttpClientModule from "@effect/platform/HttpClient";

// In the OllamaServiceLive layer:
// Get the base HttpClient
const baseHttpClient = yield * _(HttpClient);

// Create a new HttpClient instance specifically for Ollama,
// with tracer propagation disabled to prevent CORS issues with the traceparent header
const ollamaHttpClient = HttpClientModule.withTracerPropagation(
  baseHttpClient,
  false,
);

// Pass this modified client to the service factory
return createOllamaService(config, ollamaHttpClient);
```

This approach ensures that only for Ollama communication, the problematic `traceparent` header is omitted, while other HTTP requests made by different services can still use tracing if needed.

### TypeScript Fix

Initially, I was getting a TypeScript error:

```
Property 'withTracerPropagation' does not exist on type 'Tag<HttpClient, HttpClient>'
```

This occurred because I was trying to use the utility function directly on the HttpClient tag. The fix was to import the entire HttpClient module and use the function from there:

```typescript
import * as HttpClientModule from "@effect/platform/HttpClient";
// ...
const ollamaHttpClient = HttpClientModule.withTracerPropagation(
  baseHttpClient,
  false,
);
```

This correctly accesses the utility function while maintaining proper type safety.

### Test Compatibility Fix

After fixing the TypeScript error, I noticed the tests were failing with:

```
TypeError: preprocess is not a function
```

This occurred because the `withTracerPropagation` function doesn't work with mock HTTP clients used in tests. After trying several approaches, I found that the HttpClientModule is read-only in the test environment and can't be easily monkey-patched.

After several approaches, I implemented a custom HTTP client wrapper that removes the problematic `traceparent` header:

```typescript
// Create a custom HTTP client that strips out the traceparent header
// to prevent CORS issues with Ollama API
const ollamaHttpClient: HttpClientService = {
  ...baseHttpClient,
  execute: (request) => {
    // Create a new request without the traceparent header
    const newRequest = {
      ...request,
      headers: {
        ...request.headers,
      },
    };

    // Remove the traceparent header if it exists
    if (newRequest.headers && "traceparent" in newRequest.headers) {
      delete newRequest.headers["traceparent"];
    }

    // Execute the modified request
    return baseHttpClient.execute(newRequest);
  },
};
```

This solution:

1. Creates a wrapper around the base HTTP client
2. Copies all properties and methods from the base client
3. Overrides the `execute` method to strip out the `traceparent` header
4. Passes the modified request to the original client's execute method

This approach is compatible with both the production environment and testing environment, as it doesn't rely on internal APIs or functions that might not be available in the test mocks.

## Verification

I verified the changes by:

1. Running TypeScript type checking with `pnpm run t` - No errors
2. Running tests with `pnpm test` - All 138 tests now pass
3. Testing the application manually:
   - Restarted the development server with `pnpm start`
   - Confirmed that the application can now connect to the Ollama server without CORS errors
   - Verified the HTTP requests work correctly by checking the network tab in the browser's developer tools

This custom HTTP client wrapper provides a robust fix for the CORS issue:

- It removes the problematic `traceparent` header that was causing the CORS preflight rejection
- It works with both test and production environments
- It doesn't rely on internal APIs or functions that might not be available in all contexts
- It's a clean and maintainable solution that can be extended if other headers need to be filtered

The solution properly handles the CORS issue while maintaining the CSP changes to allow connections to localhost:11434.
