# Pull Request: Fix Ollama API Connection and IPC Handling

## Title

Fix Ollama API CORS issues and improve IPC reliability

## Description

This PR resolves the CORS issue that was preventing our application from connecting to the Ollama API running locally. The solution takes a comprehensive approach to ensure reliable communication between our renderer process and the Ollama API by implementing proper IPC channels through Electron's main process.

### Key Changes:

1. **Resolved CORS Issues**:

   - Identified that the `traceparent` header sent by the Effect HTTP client was causing CORS rejection
   - Implemented an Electron IPC-based solution to bypass CORS completely

2. **Enhanced IPC System**:

   - Refactored IPC event listeners registration to ensure it happens at the optimal time in the application lifecycle
   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Implemented a global flag to prevent duplicate handler registration

3. **Improved Client-Side Resilience**:

   - Added defensive coding in SellComputePane with graceful fallbacks
   - Added delayed initialization to ensure all handlers are ready
   - Implemented proper error reporting

4. **Fixed TypeScript Integration**:
   - Fixed type errors with proper error interfaces
   - Ensured consistent use of Effect and proper error typing

### Benefits:

- **Reliability**: The application now reliably connects to Ollama, regardless of browser CORS policies
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages and proper fallbacks when services are unavailable
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Detailed logs and type safety for future development

### Technical Details:

- Uses Electron's IPC system to proxy API requests through the main process
- Moves service layer initialization to a safer point in the application lifecycle
- Adds comprehensive error handling throughout the communication chain
- Fixes timing issues that were causing "No handler registered" errors

## Testing Done

- Verified that the SellComputePane component now successfully connects to Ollama
- Confirmed TypeScript type checking passes with no errors
- Tested various error scenarios to ensure graceful degradation

## Breaking Changes

None. This PR only improves existing functionality without changing any public APIs or user-facing behavior.
