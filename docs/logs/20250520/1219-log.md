# AsyncFiberException Runtime Fix Log

I'll be addressing the `AsyncFiberException` issue in the Effect runtime initialization by making the required changes to ensure asynchronous operations are properly handled during runtime initialization.

## Step 1: Examining the issue

The problem is that `Effect.runSync` is being used on an Effect program that requires asynchronous work during layer construction. Specifically, this is happening with `SparkWallet.initialize` in `SparkServiceImpl.ts`. This causes the creation of a fallback runtime missing most services, leading to "Service not found" errors.

## Step 2: Modifying src/services/runtime.ts

I've updated `src/services/runtime.ts` to:

1. Replace synchronous runtime initialization with asynchronous initialization
2. Add a `buildRuntimeAsync` function that uses `Effect.runPromise` instead of `Effect.runSync`
3. Create an `initializeMainRuntime` async function for proper initialization
4. Add a `getMainRuntime()` getter to safely access the runtime once initialized

Key changes:

- Changed from direct initialization to an async initialization function
- Added fallback mechanisms for errors during initialization
- Added proper error handling for all scenarios
- Added a minimal telemetry service for the fallback runtime

## Step 3: Updating src/renderer.ts

Updated the renderer file to properly await the initialization before rendering the app.

- Created a `startApp` async function
- Made it await `initializeMainRuntime()` before rendering React components
- Added improved error handling and logging
- Fixed TypeScript import issues with `runFork`

## Step 4: Updating components that use the runtime

Updated all files that directly import/use `mainRuntime` to use the new `getMainRuntime()` function:

1. `src/hooks/useNostrChannelChat.ts`
2. `src/components/nip90/Nip90EventList.tsx`
3. `src/components/nip90/Nip90RequestForm.tsx`
4. `src/stores/panes/actions/createNip28ChannelPane.ts`
5. Test files: `src/tests/unit/components/nip90/Nip90RequestForm.test.tsx`

## Step 5: Testing and TypeScript Fixes

1. The Nip90RequestForm unit tests pass successfully with the updated code
2. Fixed TypeScript errors related to the Context creation and usage
3. Updated `runtimeMake` to use the proper interface with `context`, `runtimeFlags` and `fiberRefs`
4. All TypeScript type-checking now passes

## Summary of Fixes

The issue was resolved by properly handling asynchronous initialization in the Effect runtime. The key insight was that `SparkWallet.initialize()` is an asynchronous operation but it was being run with `Effect.runSync`, causing an `AsyncFiberException`.

By:

1. Making the runtime initialization asynchronous with `Effect.runPromise`
2. Ensuring the app awaits runtime initialization before rendering
3. Providing a safe getter function for the runtime
4. Updating all imports and usages of the runtime
5. Ensuring proper TypeScript types throughout

...we now have a robust solution that properly handles the asynchronous nature of the SparkService initialization, which should resolve the "Service not found" errors and provide a more reliable application.
