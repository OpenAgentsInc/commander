# Implementation Log: Adding NIP-90 DVM Test and Consumer Chat Panes

## Overview

Implementing two new pane types for the NIP-90 DVM interaction:

1. NIP-90 DVM Test Pane - For testing DVM functionality locally
2. NIP-90 Consumer Chat Pane - A pane with its own identity to interact with DVMs

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Pane Structures

### 1. Updating Pane Types and Constants

First, I need to add the new pane types to the type definition and create constants for their IDs.

I've updated the following files:

- Added `nip90_dvm_test` and `nip90_consumer_chat` to the `Pane['type']` union in `src/types/pane.ts`
- Added constants in `src/stores/panes/constants.ts`:
  ```typescript
  export const NIP90_DVM_TEST_PANE_ID = "nip90_dvm_test";
  export const NIP90_DVM_TEST_PANE_TITLE = "NIP-90 DVM Test";
  export const NIP90_CONSUMER_CHAT_PANE_ID = "nip90_consumer_chat";
  export const NIP90_CONSUMER_CHAT_PANE_TITLE =
    "NIP-90 Consumer (Text Inference)";
  ```

### 2. Implementing Pane Store Actions

Created new action files for opening the panes:

- Created `src/stores/panes/actions/openNip90DvmTestPane.ts` with `openNip90DvmTestPaneAction`
- Created `src/stores/panes/actions/openNip90ConsumerChatPane.ts` with `openNip90ConsumerChatPaneAction`
- Updated `src/stores/panes/actions/index.ts` to export these actions
- Added the new action types to `PaneStoreType` in `src/stores/panes/types.ts`:
  ```typescript
  openNip90DvmTestPane: () => void; // Open NIP-90 DVM Test pane
  openNip90ConsumerChatPane: () => void; // Open NIP-90 Consumer Chat pane
  ```
- Updated the store creation in `src/stores/pane.ts` to import and include the new actions:
  ```typescript
  openNip90DvmTestPane: () => openNip90DvmTestPaneAction(set),
  openNip90ConsumerChatPane: () => openNip90ConsumerChatPaneAction(set),
  ```

### 3. Creating Placeholder Components

Created placeholder components for the new pane types:

- Created `src/components/nip90_dvm_test/Nip90DvmTestPane.tsx` with a simple placeholder component
- Created `src/components/nip90_dvm_test/index.ts` to export the component
- Created `src/components/nip90_consumer_chat/Nip90ConsumerChatPane.tsx` with a simple placeholder component
- Created `src/components/nip90_consumer_chat/index.ts` to export the component

### 4. Updating the Pane Manager

Updated the `PaneManager.tsx` component to render the new pane types:

- Imported the new components
- Added conditional rendering for the new pane types:
  ```tsx
  {
    pane.type === "nip90_dvm_test" && <Nip90DvmTestPane />;
  }
  {
    pane.type === "nip90_consumer_chat" && <Nip90ConsumerChatPane />;
  }
  ```
- Updated the fallback condition to include the new pane types

### 5. Adding Buttons to Hotbar

Modified the Hotbar component to include buttons for the new panes:

- Added imports for the new icons and constants
- Added action hooks for the new pane opening functions
- Added new `HotbarItem` entries for the new panes, using slots 7 and 8:
  ```tsx
  <HotbarItem slotNumber={7} onClick={openNip90DvmTestPane} title="NIP-90 DVM Test" isActive={activePaneId === NIP90_DVM_TEST_PANE_ID}>
    <TestTube className="w-5 h-5 text-muted-foreground" />
  </HotbarItem>
  <HotbarItem slotNumber={8} onClick={openNip90ConsumerChatPane} title="NIP-90 Consumer Chat" isActive={activePaneId === NIP90_CONSUMER_CHAT_PANE_ID}>
    <MessageCircleSquare className="w-5 h-5 text-muted-foreground" />
  </HotbarItem>
  ```
- Adjusted the empty slots array to show only one empty slot (slot 9)

### 6. Creating Tests

Created test files to verify the basic functionality of our new components and actions:

- Created `src/tests/unit/components/nip90_dvm_test/Nip90DvmTestPane.test.tsx` to test the placeholder component rendering
- Created `src/tests/unit/components/nip90_consumer_chat/Nip90ConsumerChatPane.test.tsx` to test the placeholder component rendering
- Created `src/tests/unit/stores/paneActions.test.ts` to test the pane store actions, which verifies:
  - Adding a new NIP-90 DVM test pane
  - Adding a new NIP-90 consumer chat pane
  - Bringing an existing pane to the front when reopening

This completes the Phase 1 setup of the basic pane structures. The panes successfully render placeholders, have working buttons in the Hotbar, and the store actions function correctly.

## Phase 2: NIP-90 DVM Test Pane Implementation

### 1. Modifying Kind5050DVMService for Local Test Jobs

First, I need to modify the DVM service to support local test jobs without involving the Nostr network:

1. Updated the `Kind5050DVMService.ts` interface to:

   - Add imports for `OllamaError`, `SparkError`, `NIP04EncryptError`, and `NIP04DecryptError`
   - Add support for kind 5050 in `defaultKind5050DVMServiceConfig`:
     ```typescript
     supportedJobKinds: [5050, 5100], // Support kind 5050 and 5100 for text generation
     ```
   - Add a new method to the interface:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * Processes a local test job without involving Nostr network
      * This method is used for testing the DVM functionality locally
      *
      * @param prompt The text prompt to process
      * @param requesterPkOverride Optional: simulates a request from a specific pubkey
      * @returns The processed job result text or error
      */
     processLocalTestJob(
       prompt: string,
       requesterPkOverride?: string
     ): Effect.Effect<string, DVMError | OllamaError | SparkError | NIP04EncryptError | NIP04DecryptError>;
     ```

2. Implemented the method in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts`:
   - Added the function implementation that:
     - Uses the same configuration and Ollama integration as normal jobs
     - Performs Ollama inference with the prompt
     - Creates a mock invoice (since it's just a local test)
     - Optionally encrypts the result if requesterPkOverride is provided
     - Returns the result directly without publishing to Nostr
   - Added proper error handling and telemetry tracking
   - Exported the method as part of the service interface

### 2. Implementing Nip90DvmTestPane UI

I implemented the `Nip90DvmTestPane` component with:

1. **Status Indicators and Controls:**

   - Wallet connection status indicator with refresh button
   - Ollama connection status indicator with refresh button
   - GO ONLINE/GO OFFLINE button to control the DVM service

2. **Test Job Interface:**

   - Text input field for entering test prompts
   - "Send Test Job to Self" button to trigger local job processing
   - Results display area showing either the successful response or error message

3. **Integration with Kind5050DVMService:**

   - Reused connection check functions from SellComputePane
   - Added `handleSendTestJob` function that calls `processLocalTestJob` from the DVM service:

     ```typescript
     const handleSendTestJob = async () => {
       if (!isOnline) {
         alert("DVM is not online. Go online first to send a test job.");
         return;
       }
       setIsTestJobRunning(true);
       setTestJobResult(null);
       setTestJobError(null);

       const program = Effect.flatMap(Kind5050DVMService, (service) =>
         service.processLocalTestJob(testPrompt),
       );
       const exit = await Effect.runPromiseExit(
         Effect.provide(program, runtime),
       );

       if (Exit.isSuccess(exit)) {
         setTestJobResult(exit.value);
       } else {
         const error = Cause.squash(exit.cause);
         setTestJobError(error.message || "Unknown error processing test job.");
         console.error("Test job error:", error);
       }
       setIsTestJobRunning(false);
     };
     ```

4. **User Experience:**

   - Added loading indicators for all asynchronous operations
   - Added validation to prevent sending test jobs when DVM is offline
   - Styled the component to match the application's design system
   - Added a ScrollArea for displaying response results

5. **Testing:**
   - Updated the test to verify the component renders correctly
   - Added mocks for the Effect library and runtime services

This implementation allows users to test the DVM functionality directly within the application, without needing to set up a separate client or use the Nostr network. The DVM Test pane provides a complete interface for starting/stopping the DVM service and sending test jobs to verify it's working correctly.

This completes the implementation of the NIP-90 DVM Test Pane. We've successfully:

1. Added support for the local testing of DVM functionality through the new `processLocalTestJob` method in the `Kind5050DVMService`
2. Created a fully functional UI for testing the DVM, including connection status indicators, service controls, and a test job interface
3. Integrated the UI with the service layer to provide a seamless testing experience

The implementation follows best practices by:

- Reusing existing service interfaces and patterns
- Ensuring proper error handling and loading states
- Following the application's design system and UI patterns
- Including appropriate tests

## Next Steps

Future phases will implement:

- NIP-90 Consumer Chat pane identity management and wallet functionality
- Adding chat and NIP-90 event generation to the Consumer pane
- Testing the full integration

This implementation gives users a way to test the DVM functionality directly in the application, making it easier to verify that the infrastructure is working correctly before attempting to process actual Nostr-based NIP-90 requests.
