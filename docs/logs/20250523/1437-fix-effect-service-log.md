# Fix Effect Service Invoice Bug - Implementation Log

## Task Overview
Fixing the critical invoice extraction bug in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts` and adding comprehensive telemetry to track NIP-90 subscription events.

## Root Cause Identified
- Agent chat uses `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive` (Effect service), not `useNip90ConsumerChat` hook
- Invoice extracted from wrong position: `amountTag[1]` instead of `amountTag[2]` per NIP-90 spec
- Missing telemetry in the actual code path being used

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix invoice extraction bug in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts` line 287
2. Add telemetry to `NIP90ServiceImpl.subscribeToJobUpdates` to track events
3. Test the changes

## Step 1: Fix Invoice Extraction Bug ✅

Fixed critical issue in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`:

**Before (WRONG):**
```typescript
if (amountTag && amountTag[1]) {
  const invoice = amountTag[1];
  const amountSats = 3; // TODO: Extract from bolt11 invoice
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```typescript
if (amountTag && amountTag[2]) {  // FIX: Invoice is at position 2, not 1!
  const invoice = amountTag[2];  // FIX: Per NIP-90 spec: ["amount", "millisats", "invoice"]
  const amountSats = Math.ceil(parseInt(amountTag[1]) / 1000); // Convert millisats to sats
```

**Changes made:**
1. Fixed invoice extraction from `amountTag[2]` (per NIP-90 spec)
2. Fixed amount calculation to properly convert millisats to sats
3. Added validation for amountTag[2] instead of amountTag[1]

## Step 2: Add Telemetry to NIP90ServiceImpl ✅

Added comprehensive telemetry to `NIP90ServiceImpl.subscribeToJobUpdates`:

### Telemetry Events Added:

1. **filters_created** - Logs the exact filters being used:
   ```typescript
   category: "nip90:subscription", 
   action: "filters_created",
   value: `Result: ${JSON.stringify(resultFilter)} | Feedback: ${JSON.stringify(feedbackFilter)}`
   ```

2. **event_received** - Logs EVERY event that reaches the handler:
   ```typescript
   category: "nip90:subscription",
   action: "event_received", 
   value: `Kind: ${event.kind} | Job: ${jobRequestEventId} | Author: ${event.pubkey}`
   ```

3. **kind_7000_feedback_received** - Specific tracking for feedback events:
   ```typescript
   category: "nip90:subscription",
   action: "kind_7000_feedback_received",
   value: `Content: ${event.content.substring(0, 50)}... | Tags: ${JSON.stringify(event.tags)}`
   ```

4. **subscription_created_successfully** - Confirms subscription was established:
   ```typescript
   category: "nip90:subscription", 
   action: "subscription_created_successfully",
   value: `Subscribed to ${subscriptionRelays.length} relays for result + feedback events`
   ```

### Import Added:
- Added `getMainRuntime` import for telemetry execution in event handlers

## Step 3: Test the Changes ✅

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced by our changes
- ✅ Project builds without issues related to our modifications
- ❌ Existing test type errors remain (unrelated to our fixes)

### Code Quality Check
- ✅ Invoice extraction bug fixed in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
- ✅ Comprehensive telemetry added to `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts`
- ✅ All imports properly added
- ✅ Effect patterns used correctly

## Implementation Summary

### Critical Fixes Made:

1. **Invoice Extraction Bug (ROOT CAUSE)** ✅
   - Fixed `amountTag[1]` → `amountTag[2]` (per NIP-90 spec)
   - Fixed amount calculation from hardcoded 3 sats to proper millisat conversion
   - Added proper validation for invoice presence

2. **Comprehensive Telemetry** ✅
   - Added 4 new telemetry events to track subscription lifecycle
   - Tracks filter creation, event reception, Kind 7000 feedback, and subscription success
   - Uses proper Effect runtime context for telemetry in event handlers

### Expected Impact:

**Before:** Consumer fails to pay because invoice extracted from wrong tag position
**After:** Consumer correctly extracts invoice from `amountTag[2]` and triggers auto-payment

**Before:** No visibility into subscription event flow
**After:** Complete telemetry tracking of subscription creation and event reception

### Next Test Run:

The next test should show:
1. ✅ `filters_created` telemetry with correct Kind 7000 filter
2. ✅ `subscription_created_successfully` telemetry 
3. ✅ `event_received` telemetry when provider publishes feedback
4. ✅ `kind_7000_feedback_received` telemetry with event content
5. ✅ Auto-payment triggered for small amounts (≤ 10 sats)
6. ✅ Payment success and DVM processing completion

The fixes address the exact issues identified in the analysis:
- Wrong invoice position (major bug)
- Missing telemetry in the actual code path being used
- Amount calculation error

These changes should resolve the payment failure issue in the agent chat flow.
