# Payment Failure Analysis #12 - Critical Discovery

## SHOCKING DISCOVERY: Still NO Events Received!

Despite completely changing the subscription approach from `subscribeMany()` to separate `subscribe()` calls, the consumer STILL receives absolutely NO events.

## Timeline Analysis

### Consumer Timeline
1. **1748027630774** - Job request published
2. **1748027632317** - Job published successfully (1.54 seconds)
3. **1748027632318** - Subscription created 
4. **1748027632319** - NostrServiceImpl logs subscription created
5. **NEVER** - No "job_update_received" events
6. **NEVER** - No "subscription_eose" events

### Provider Timeline  
1. **1748027627168** - DVM starts listening
2. **1748027628223** - Provider DOES receive EOSE
3. **1748027631406** - Receives job request (948ms before consumer subscription!)
4. **1748027633616** - Creates payment feedback event
5. **1748027633623** - Publishing payment event
6. **1748027633800** - Payment event published successfully

## Critical Discovery: Subscription vs Publish Timing

The provider publishes the payment event at **1748027633800** which is **1.48 seconds AFTER** the consumer created its subscription at **1748027632319**.

So timing is NOT the issue - the subscription was active well before the payment event was published.

## Key Insight: NostrServiceImpl vs Consumer Pool Usage

Looking at line 76 in consumer logs:
```
TelemetryServiceImpl.ts:111 [Telemetry] {category: 'log:info', action: 'nostr_sub_created', label: '[Nostr] Created subscription'
```

This proves that the subscription IS being created via NostrServiceImpl, but the consumer's own subscription calls are NOT working.

## The Real Problem: Different Pool Instances!

### Consumer Flow:
1. Uses its own `poolRef.current.subscribe()` calls
2. NEVER receives any events or EOSE

### NostrServiceImpl (working):
1. Creates subscription via internal pool
2. Successfully logs subscription creation
3. But this is NOT the same subscription the consumer is creating!

## Root Cause Analysis

The consumer is using two different Nostr pools:

1. **Consumer's SimplePool** (`poolRef.current`) - Created in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`
2. **NostrServiceImpl's pool** - Used for publishing and internal subscriptions

The NostrServiceImpl successfully creates subscriptions that work, but the consumer's own SimplePool subscriptions don't receive events.

## Evidence from Logs

### What Works (NostrServiceImpl):
- Line 76: `nostr_sub_created` - subscription logged 
- Provider receives EOSE and events normally

### What Doesn't Work (Consumer SimplePool):
- Consumer's `onevent` callbacks NEVER fire
- Consumer's `oneose` callbacks NEVER fire  
- No "job_update_received" logs
- No "subscription_eose" logs

## The Fix Required

The consumer should NOT use its own SimplePool. Instead, it should use the NostrService for subscriptions, just like it uses NostrService for publishing.

The consumer currently:
- ✅ Uses NostrService for publishing (works)
- ❌ Uses own SimplePool for subscribing (doesn't work)

## Recommended Solution

Replace the consumer's SimplePool subscriptions with NostrService subscriptions:

```typescript
// Instead of:
const resultSub = poolRef.current.subscribe(...)

// Use:
const resultSub = yield* _(nostr.subscribeToEvents(...))
```

This would make the consumer use the same working Nostr infrastructure that the provider uses successfully.

## Why This Explains Everything

This explains why:
1. Multiple subscription attempts have failed
2. Different SimplePool API patterns don't work
3. The provider (using NostrService) works perfectly
4. The consumer never receives any events despite "correct" subscriptions

The issue isn't with the subscription syntax - it's that the consumer is using a completely different, non-functional Nostr pool system!
