# Implementation Log: Replace Consumer SimplePool with NostrService

## Task Overview
Refactoring `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` to use NostrService instead of SimplePool for subscriptions, following instructions in `1417-instructions.md`.

**Root Cause:** Consumer uses broken SimplePool for subscriptions while NostrService (used for publishing and by provider) works perfectly.

## Implementation Plan
1. Import NostrService and remove SimplePool dependency  
2. Replace SimplePool subscriptions with NostrService subscriptions
3. Update cleanup logic
4. Ensure publishing consistency
5. Test the changes

## Step 1: Update Imports and Remove SimplePool ✅

- Removed SimplePool import
- Added NostrService import  
- Removed poolRef.current SimplePool initialization
- Updated cleanup logic to use unsub() method instead of close()

## Step 2: Remove SimplePool Check in sendMessage ✅

Removed poolRef.current validation in sendMessage function.

## Step 3: Replace Publishing with NostrService ✅

Replaced:
```typescript
const publishPromises = poolRef.current.publish(DEFAULT_RELAYS, signedEvent);
await Promise.any(publishPromises);
```

With:
```typescript
const nostrService = Context.get(currentRuntime.context, NostrService);
const publishEffect = nostrService.publishEvent(signedEvent, DEFAULT_RELAYS);
await Effect.runPromise(publishEffect.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)));
```

## Step 4: Replace Subscriptions with NostrService ✅

Replaced SimplePool subscription calls with NostrService pattern:
```typescript
const subscribeEffect = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const resultSub = yield* nostrService.subscribeToEvents([filters[0]], handleEvent, DEFAULT_RELAYS, () => handleEose("result"));
  const feedbackSub = yield* nostrService.subscribeToEvents([filters[1]], handleEvent, DEFAULT_RELAYS, () => handleEose("feedback"));
  return { resultSub, feedbackSub };
});
```

## Step 5: Update Cleanup Logic ✅

Updated all subscription cleanup to use `unsub()` instead of `close()`:
```typescript
if (resultSub && typeof resultSub.unsub === 'function') resultSub.unsub();
```

## Step 6: Fix PublishEvent Method Call ✅

Fixed incorrect method signature - `publishEvent` only takes one parameter (the event), not two:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
const publishEffect = nostrService.publishEvent(signedEvent, DEFAULT_RELAYS);

// After (correct):
const publishEffect = nostrService.publishEvent(signedEvent);
```

## Testing Implementation ✅

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in our modified file
- ✅ Pre-existing test errors remain but unrelated to our changes

### Test Results
- ✅ useNip90ConsumerChat test is skipped (expected)
- ✅ General test suite runs without new failures

## Implementation Summary

**Successfully refactored `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` to use NostrService instead of SimplePool:**

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Removed SimplePool import and usage
2. ✅ Added NostrService import
3. ✅ Replaced SimplePool publishing with NostrService.publishEvent()
4. ✅ Replaced SimplePool subscriptions with NostrService.subscribeToEvents()
5. ✅ Updated cleanup logic to use unsub() instead of close()
6. ✅ Removed poolRef.current validation check

### Expected Impact:
Based on the root cause analysis in `1410-analysis.md`:
- Consumer should now receive "subscription_eose" events
- Consumer should now receive "job_update_received" events when payment events arrive
- Payment-required events should reach the consumer callbacks
- Auto-payment flow should trigger correctly
- End-to-end payment flow should work

### What Changed:
The consumer now uses the same working NostrService infrastructure that:
- The provider uses successfully for receiving job requests
- The consumer already uses successfully for publishing job requests
- NostrServiceImpl uses for internal subscriptions (which work)

This eliminates the broken SimplePool subscription system that was preventing the consumer from receiving any events.

## Step 7: Add Detailed Kind 7000 Subscription Telemetry ✅

After analysis in `1427-payfail13-analysis.md`, discovered that despite Kind 7000 being in filters, telemetry logs showed consumer wasn't receiving Kind 7000 events. Added comprehensive telemetry:

### Filter Debug Telemetry:
```typescript
telemetry.trackEvent({
  category: "nip90_consumer",
  action: "subscription_filters_debug", 
  value: `Result filter kinds: [${filters[0].kinds}] | Feedback filter kinds: [${filters[1].kinds}]`,
});

telemetry.trackEvent({
  category: "nip90_consumer", 
  action: "kind_7000_subscription_confirmed",
  value: `Subscribing to Kind 7000 feedback events for job`,
});
```

### Subscription Creation Telemetry:
- `creating_result_subscription` - Logs result filter details
- `creating_feedback_subscription` - Logs Kind 7000 feedback filter details  
- `both_subscriptions_created` - Confirms both subscriptions are active

### Event Handler Telemetry:
```typescript
if (event.kind === 7000) {
  telemetryForEvent.trackEvent({
    category: "nip90_consumer", 
    action: "kind_7000_feedback_received",
    value: `Feedback event received! Content: ${event.content.substring(0, 50)}`,
  });
}
```

This will definitively show:
1. ✅ Whether Kind 7000 is in the consumer's subscription filters
2. ✅ Whether the feedback subscription is created successfully  
3. ✅ Whether Kind 7000 events actually reach the consumer's event handler
4. ✅ If events are received, what their content contains

Expected outcome: Logs should now clearly show if Kind 7000 events are being received by consumer or if there's still a deeper subscription issue.
