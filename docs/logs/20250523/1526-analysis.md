# NIP-90 Payment Failure Analysis

## Summary
The payment is being made successfully by the consumer, but the provider is not detecting it because it's failing to fetch its own DVM history from relays when checking invoice statuses.

## Key Evidence

### Consumer Side (lines 82-91):
```
line 82: payment_required event received with 3 sats invoice
line 83: auto_payment_triggered for 3 sats
line 84: pay_invoice_start
line 89: pay_invoice_success with status: FAILED (but balance changed from 500 to 497)
line 90: payment_success tracked with hash: unknown-hash
```

**Critical Issue**: The payment reports as "FAILED" but still deducted 3 sats from balance (500 â†’ 497), indicating the payment actually succeeded.

### Provider Side (lines 82-117):
```
line 82: received_job_request
line 84: create_invoice_start for 3 sats
line 85: create_invoice_success
line 106: check_invoice_status_start
line 107: check_invoice_status_success - status: pending
line 109: get_job_history_start
line 114: Invoice check error: DVMServiceError: Failed to fetch DVM history from relays
```

**Critical Issue**: The provider cannot fetch its own job history from relays to check completed payments.

## Root Causes

1. **Payment Status Misreporting**: SparkService is returning payment status as "FAILED" even when the payment succeeds (balance decreased correctly).

2. **DVM History Fetch Failure**: The provider's attempt to fetch its own job history is failing, preventing it from discovering successful payments and processing jobs.

3. **Missing Payment Hash**: The consumer receives "unknown-hash" as the payment hash, which makes it impossible to properly track the payment.

## Impact

Even though payments are succeeding (balance changes confirm this), the provider never processes the jobs because:
1. It can't fetch its job history to see completed payments
2. The invoice status check only shows "pending" 
3. The error prevents the provider from continuing to process the job

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix SparkService Payment Status**: Investigate why successful payments are being reported as "FAILED"
2. **Fix Payment Hash Extraction**: Ensure the payment hash is properly extracted from the payment response
3. **Fix DVM History Fetching**: Debug why the provider can't fetch its own events from relays
4. **Add Fallback Payment Detection**: Consider alternative methods to detect successful payments if history fetch fails
