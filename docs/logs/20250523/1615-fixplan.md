# Test and TypeScript Error Fix Plan

## Overview
We have TypeScript compilation errors and failing tests that need to be addressed. The issues fall into several categories:

1. **SparkService TypeScript errors** - Property access on wrong types
2. **Test dependency issues** - Missing TelemetryService provisions
3. **NIP-13 test failures** - PoW validation and mining tests
4. **Integration test failures** - Playwright and Effect runtime issues

## Priority Order
Fix in this order to minimize cascading issues:
1. SparkService TypeScript errors (blocking compilation)
2. Test dependency provisions (most test failures)
3. NIP-13 test issues (isolated to one service)
4. Integration test setup (complex but lower priority)

---

## 1. SparkService TypeScript Errors

### Problem
```typescript
src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts(510,38): error TS2339: Property 'paymentHash' does not exist on type 'LightningSendRequest'.
src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts(537,29): error TS2339: Property 'error' does not exist on type 'LightningSendRequest'.
```

### Root Cause
We're accessing properties on `sdkResult` that don't exist on the `LightningSendRequest` type. The SDK returns a different type.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check what type the SDK actually returns from `wallet.payLightningInvoice()`
2. Look at the SDK types or inspect runtime to understand the actual response shape
3. Cast to the correct type or use type guards
4. The properties we need might be on a different path (e.g., `sdkResult.response.paymentHash`)

### Action Items
- [ ] Inspect `@buildonspark/spark-sdk` types for the actual return type
- [ ] Fix property access to match actual SDK response structure
- [ ] Consider adding runtime logging to see actual response shape

---

## 2. Test Dependency Issues

### Problem
Multiple test files have the same error pattern:
```typescript
Argument of type 'Effect<void, never, TelemetryService>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Effect<void, never, never>'.
```

### Root Cause
Tests are not providing TelemetryService when running Effects that require it.

### Fix Strategy
For each failing test file:
1. Import `TelemetryServiceLive` 
2. Add `.pipe(Effect.provide(TelemetryServiceLive))` before `Effect.runPromise()`
3. Or create a test layer that includes TelemetryService

### Action Items
- [ ] Fix `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.test.ts` - 7 instances
- [ ] Fix `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.integration.test.ts` - 2 instances
- [ ] Consider creating a shared test runtime with common services

---

## 3. NIP-13 Test Failures

### Problem
Three NIP-13 tests are failing:
1. `validatePoW > should validate PoW correctly` - assertion failure
2. `mineEvent > should mine a simple event with low difficulty` - timeout
3. `mineEvent > should fail mining with impossible difficulty` - timeout

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Validation test**: Likely the test data doesn't match the expected difficulty
2. **Mining timeouts**: Mining is taking too long, possibly due to:
   - Incorrect difficulty calculation
   - Inefficient mining algorithm
   - Test expectations not matching implementation

### Fix Strategy
1. Review the validatePoW test - check if the test event actually has valid PoW
2. For mining tests:
   - Reduce difficulty targets for tests
   - Add progress logging to understand where it's stuck
   - Consider mocking the mining for unit tests

### Action Items
- [ ] Debug validatePoW test - print actual vs expected difficulty
- [ ] Lower difficulty targets in mining tests (e.g., 8 bits instead of 16)
- [ ] Add timeout configuration to mining tests
- [ ] Consider splitting into unit tests (mocked) vs integration tests (actual mining)

---

## 4. Integration Test Failures

### Problem
- Playwright test setup error
- Runtime initialization tests failing (likely due to ecc library issues)

### Root Cause
1. **Playwright**: Version mismatch or incorrect test setup
2. **Runtime tests**: Bitcoin/ECC library not initialized properly in test environment

### Fix Strategy
1. Skip or fix Playwright e2e tests (low priority)
2. For runtime tests:
   - Mock SparkService to avoid ECC initialization
   - Or properly initialize ECC library in test setup

### Action Items
- [ ] Add `initEccLib()` to test setup files that need bitcoin operations
- [ ] Or use mock implementations for integration tests
- [ ] Consider skipping e2e tests until Playwright setup is fixed

---

## 5. Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Fix Compilation (Critical)
1. Fix SparkService property access issues
2. Run `pnpm t` to verify TypeScript compiles

### Phase 2: Fix Unit Tests (High Priority)
1. Add TelemetryService provisions to all failing tests
2. Fix NIP-13 validatePoW test data
3. Adjust NIP-13 mining test parameters

### Phase 3: Fix Integration Tests (Medium Priority)
1. Add ECC library initialization or mocks
2. Fix runtime initialization tests

### Phase 4: Skip/Defer (Low Priority)
1. Mark Playwright tests as skipped
2. Document need for e2e test setup fix

---

## Quick Wins
1. The TelemetryService provision is mechanical - same fix pattern for all
2. NIP-13 test difficulty can be lowered to make tests pass quickly
3. SparkService fix might just need checking actual SDK docs

## Testing Strategy
After each phase:
1. Run `pnpm t` to check TypeScript
2. Run `pnpm test` to verify tests pass
3. Commit working state before moving to next phase
