# NIP90 Kind 5050 Event Listening Fix - Log

## Started: Reading telemetry and handshake problem logs

### Initial Analysis from logs/20250523/0017-modelswitch-log.md and 0045-handshake-problem.md

**Key Issue Identified**: Consumer is successfully creating kind 5050 events and publishing them, but **only subscribing to event kinds 6000+** instead of listening for 5050 responses.

From the telemetry in 0045-handshake-problem.md:
- Line 373: `nip90_job_request_published` - Job request published with Kind: 5050
- Line 375: `nostr_sub_created` - Subscription created with filters: `[{"kinds":[6000,6001,6002,6003,6004,600...]}`

**Problem**: We're publishing 5050 requests but only listening for 6000+ responses. Missing subscription to kind 5050 responses from DVMs.

## Analysis of Current NIP90 Implementation

### Key Files Analyzed:
1. `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts:638-653` - `subscribeToJobUpdates` method
2. `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts:198-230` - Streaming implementation
3. DVM specification from data-vending-machines.org

### Current Subscription Pattern (CORRECT):
- `resultFilter.kinds: Array.from({length: 1000}, (_, i) => 6000 + i)` - Result events (6000-6999)
- `feedbackFilter.kinds: [7000]` - Feedback events

### Key Discovery:
According to NIP-90 spec, **5050 is a REQUEST kind, not a response kind**. The proper flow is:
1. Consumer sends **kind 5050** request (what we're doing correctly)
2. DVM responds with **kind 6050** result (what we're listening for correctly)
3. DVM can send **kind 7000** feedback (what we're listening for correctly)

**The issue is NOT the subscription kinds - they are correct.**

## Deep Investigation: Subscription Filter Analysis

Looking at the telemetry, I need to identify the real problem. Let me examine the exact subscription being created:

From line 375: `nostr_sub_created` with filters: `[{"kinds":[6000,6001,6002,6003,6004,600...]}`

### Potential Issues to Investigate:
1. **DVM Public Key Filter**: Are we filtering by the correct DVM author?
2. **Event Reference Filter**: Are we using the correct `#e` tag to reference our job request?
3. **Relay Coverage**: Is the DVM publishing to the same relays we're subscribed to?
4. **Missing 5050 in Response Chain**: Does the DVM know how to respond to our specific 5050 request?

### Next Steps:
- Check the exact subscription filters being created
- Verify DVM configuration (public key, relays)
- Test if DVM is online and responding to any requests

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Root Cause Found

**The issue is the placeholder DVM public key!**

In `ConfigurationServiceImpl.ts:113`:
```typescript
yield* _(configService.set("AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_DVM_PUBKEY", "YOUR_DEVSTRAL_DVM_PUBKEY_HEX"));
```

From the telemetry logs line 19 and 478:
```
[NIP90 Helper] Invalid targetDvmPkHexForEncryption ('YOUR_DEVSTRAL_DVM_PUBKEY_HEX'). Sending unencrypted request.
```

### The Real Problem:
1. We're using a **placeholder DVM public key** `"YOUR_DEVSTRAL_DVM_PUBKEY_HEX"`
2. This means our subscription filter `authors: [dvmPubkeyHex]` is filtering for events from a non-existent DVM
3. No real DVM has this public key, so we'll never receive responses
4. We need to update the configuration with a **real DVM public key**

### Solution:
Replace the placeholder with an actual working DVM public key that provides text generation services.
