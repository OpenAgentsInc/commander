# Critical Wallet Fix - 0845

## Problem Analysis
From telemetry logs, I can see:
1. Runtime is built with user's mnemonic: "deliver cr..."
2. Runtime is built AGAIN with test mnemonic: "test test ..."
3. The test mnemonic runtime is the one being used for balance queries
4. Balance shows 48 sats (from test wallet) instead of user's balance

## Root Cause
The runtime was ALWAYS building with a fallback to test mnemonic:
```typescript
const userMnemonic = globalWalletConfig.mnemonic || "test test test test test test test test test test test junk";
```

This means even after reinitialization, if there's any timing issue, it falls back to test wallet.

## Investigation Process
1. Started with symptom: User still seeing 48 sats after entering their seed phrase
2. Added debug logging to track mnemonic usage in runtime and SparkService
3. Discovered runtime was being built twice - once with user mnemonic, once with test
4. Traced back to the fallback pattern in runtime.ts

## Solution Implemented
1. **Remove ALL test mnemonic usage from production runtime**
   - When no wallet is initialized, use SparkServiceTestLive (mock) instead
   - Mock returns 0 balance when no wallet exists
   - NEVER use the hardcoded test mnemonic

2. **Updated runtime.ts**:
   ```typescript
   if (globalWalletConfig.mnemonic) {
     // Use real SparkService with user's mnemonic
     sparkLayer = SparkServiceLive.pipe(...);
   } else {
     // Use mock SparkService that returns 0 balance
     sparkLayer = SparkServiceTestLive.pipe(...);
   }
   ```

3. **Updated SparkServiceTestImpl**:
   - Detects "mock_no_wallet" mnemonic
   - Returns 0 balance instead of test balance
   - Properly handles the no-wallet state

4. **Security improvement**:
   - Removed mnemonic logging that exposed first 10 chars
   - Now only logs network information

## Previous Attempts That Failed
1. **Getting fresh runtime on each query**: While this helped ensure latest runtime was used, it didn't fix the root cause
2. **Invalidating React Query cache**: Helped with stale data but didn't address test mnemonic usage
3. **Wallet store reinitialization**: The timing of rehydration vs runtime initialization created race conditions

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Never use fallback values for sensitive data**: The `|| "test value"` pattern is dangerous for credentials
2. **Telemetry is crucial**: The logs clearly showed the double initialization with different mnemonics
3. **Mock services are safer than test data**: Using SparkServiceTestImpl is better than hardcoded test credentials
4. **Runtime initialization order matters**: Store rehydration happens after initial runtime creation
5. **Don't log sensitive data**: Even partial mnemonic exposure (first 10 chars) is a security risk

## Result
- No more test wallet mnemonic in production code
- Users without wallet see 0 balance (not 48 sats)
- Users with wallet see their actual balance
- No security risk from shared test wallet

## Files Changed
- `src/services/runtime.ts` - Removed test mnemonic fallback, use mock service instead
- `src/services/spark/SparkServiceTestImpl.ts` - Updated to return 0 for no-wallet state
- `src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts` - Removed mnemonic substring logging
- `src/components/wallet/WalletPane.tsx` - Get fresh runtime on each query
- `src/components/hud/BitcoinBalanceDisplay.tsx` - Get fresh runtime on each query
- `src/stores/walletStore.ts` - Invalidate queries after runtime reinitialization
- `src/App.tsx` - Make queryClient globally available

## Testing
- All unit tests pass (279 passed, 14 skipped)
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Manual testing confirms correct balance display
