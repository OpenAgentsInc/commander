# Payment Failure 8 Analysis: Relay Mismatch

## Executive Summary

**The relays HAVE been updated correctly** - no more PoW mining is happening. However, there's a critical relay mismatch: the consumer publishes job requests to `nostr.mom/relay.primal.net/offchain.pub` while the provider only listens on `nos.lol`. They're literally on different networks.

## Confirmed: New Relays Are Being Used

### Consumer Publishing (✅ CORRECT)
```
[Nostr] Publishing event 04c0de913a1033a7680285c47d92decabb5d7a4d48bc13b59ca5eaac1b1fc594
[Nostr] Publishing to 3 relays
Successfully published to all 3 relays: wss://nostr.mom/, wss://relay.primal.net/, wss://offchain.pub/
```

### Provider Listening (❌ WRONG RELAY)
```
[DVM] Subscription 609cb24c created for relay wss://nos.lol, kinds: 5050,5100
[Nostr] Subscribing to relay wss://nos.lol with sub: sub-609cb24c
```

## The Critical Problem: They're Not On The Same Network

```
Consumer:  [Publishes Job] → nostr.mom, relay.primal.net, offchain.pub
                                            ↓
                                    (Job exists here)
                                            ↓
Provider:  [Listening...] ← nos.lol ← (Nothing arrives)
```

The consumer correctly publishes to the new relays, but the provider is still hardcoded to listen on `nos.lol` only.

## Why This Happened

Looking at the code paths:

### 1. Consumer Uses NostrService Config ✅
The consumer correctly uses the updated `NostrServiceConfig` which now has:
```typescript
relayConfigs: [
  { url: "wss://nostr.mom" },
  { url: "wss://relay.primal.net" },
  { url: "wss://offchain.pub" }
]
```

### 2. Provider Hardcoded to nos.lol ❌
The provider (DVM) is likely hardcoded to use `nos.lol` in its configuration:
```typescript
// In DVMService or similar
const DVM_RELAY = "wss://nos.lol";
```

### 3. Consumer Also Subscribes to Wrong Relay
After publishing, the consumer subscribes for responses on `nos.lol`:
```
Subscribing to events with filters on relay wss://nos.lol
```

This creates a double mismatch:
1. Provider doesn't see the job (listening on wrong relay)
2. Consumer wouldn't see the response even if provider did respond (subscribing on wrong relay)

## Immediate Fix Required

### Find Where DVM Relay is Configured

Check these files:
1. `src/services/dvm/Kind5050DVMService.ts` - DVM relay configuration
2. `src/services/nip90/NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` - Where it subscribes for updates
3. `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` - Consumer subscription relay

### Update All Three Components

**DVM Service** - Make it listen on the same relays:
```typescript
// Should use the same relays as NostrService
const relays = ["wss://nostr.mom", "wss://relay.primal.net", "wss://offchain.pub"];
```

**NIP90Service** - Subscribe on the same relays:
```typescript
subscribeToJobUpdates(jobId, callback, relays) // Pass relay array
```

**Consumer Hook** - Use consistent relays:
```typescript
const RELAYS = ["wss://nostr.mom", "wss://relay.primal.net", "wss://offchain.pub"];
```

## Verification: No PoW Issues

✅ **Confirmed: No PoW mining is happening**
- No mining telemetry in either log
- Events publish immediately
- The relay update successfully eliminated PoW

The ONLY issue is the relay mismatch.

## Expected Flow After Fix

```
Consumer:  [Publishes Job] → nostr.mom, relay.primal.net, offchain.pub
                                            ↓
Provider:  [Listening...] ← nostr.mom, relay.primal.net, offchain.pub
                                            ↓
                                    (Receives job!)
                                            ↓
Provider:  [Process & Invoice] → nostr.mom, relay.primal.net, offchain.pub
                                            ↓
Consumer:  [Receives Invoice] ← nostr.mom, relay.primal.net, offchain.pub
                                            ↓
                                      (Payment flow continues)
```

## Root Cause

The relay configuration is scattered across multiple services:
1. **NostrService** - Updated ✅
2. **DVMService** - Still using old relay ❌
3. **NIP90Service** - Hardcoded subscriptions ❌
4. **Consumer hooks** - Mixed relay usage ❌

We need to centralize relay configuration so all components use the same relays.

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Update DVM to listen on new relays
2. **Immediate**: Update consumer to subscribe on new relays
3. **Better**: Create a central relay configuration that all services use
4. **Best**: Pass relay config through the service layers

The good news: PoW is gone, relays are updated in NostrService. We just need to propagate the relay changes to all components.
