Okay, Agent, the payment is still failing in the NIP-90 consumer flow, as confirmed by the telemetry in `docs/logs/20250523/1059-telemetry-payfail2-*.md`. The DVM (provider) correctly issues an invoice and waits, but the consumer (our app) isn't successfully making the payment, even though the user's wallet is initialized and funded.

The root cause, as detailed in `docs/logs/20250523/1042-payfail-analysis.md` and the general fix pattern `docs/fixes/023-effect-runtime-stale-references.md`, is that `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` is using a stale Effect runtime instance when attempting to pay the invoice. This stale runtime likely contains a mock or unconfigured `SparkService`.

Your task is to fix this by ensuring `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` always uses the most current runtime instance for all Effect-based operations.

**Specific Instructions:**

1.  **Target File:**
    *   Modify `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`.

2.  **Apply Stale Runtime Fix Pattern (`docs/fixes/023-effect-runtime-stale-references.md`):**
    *   **Remove Stored Runtime References:**
        *   Delete `const runtimeRef = useRef(getMainRuntime());` if it exists.
        *   Remove the `runtime` prop from `UseNip90ConsumerChatParams` interface and from the hook's function signature. This makes the hook self-sufficient in obtaining the current runtime.
        *   Remove `runtimeRef.current` or the `runtime` prop from all `useCallback` and `useEffect` dependency arrays.
    *   **Dynamically Get Runtime in Callbacks/Effects:**
        *   In every asynchronous callback or `useEffect` block where an Effect program is executed (e.g., `handlePayment`, `sendMessage`, and the main `useEffect` for Nostr subscriptions and event handling), call `getMainRuntime()` *inside* that callback/effect block to get the fresh, current runtime instance.
        *   Pass this `currentRuntime` instance to `Effect.provide(...)` when running the Effect programs (e.g., `Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)))`).

3.  **Update `handlePayment` in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Ensure it gets the `currentRuntime = getMainRuntime();` at the beginning of the callback.
    *   The `payEffect` should resolve `SparkService.Tag` and `TelemetryService.Tag` from this `currentRuntime`.
    *   Provide `currentRuntime` to `Effect.runPromiseExit(payEffect.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)))`.
    *   **Add Telemetry:**
        *   Inside `payEffect`, before calling `spark.payLightningInvoice`, track a `payment_start` event.
            ```typescript
            yield* telemetry.trackEvent({
              category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
              action: "payment_start",
              label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`,
              value: `Invoice: ${invoice.substring(0,30)}... Amount: ${paymentState.amountSats || 'unknown'} sats`
            });
            ```
        *   On successful payment (inside `Exit.isSuccess(paymentExit)`), track a `payment_success` event.
            ```typescript
            Effect.runFork(
              Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent({
                category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
                action: "payment_success",
                label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`,
                value: paymentResult.paymentHash
              })).pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)) // Use the same currentRuntime
            );
            ```
        *   On payment failure (inside `else` for `Exit.isFailure`), track a `payment_failure` event.
            ```typescript
            Effect.runFork(
              Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent({
                category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
                action: "payment_failure",
                label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`,
                value: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
              })).pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)) // Use the same currentRuntime
            );
            ```

4.  **Update `sendMessage` in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Ensure it gets `currentRuntime = getMainRuntime();` at the beginning.
    *   Resolve `TelemetryService.Tag` and `NIP04Service.Tag` from this `currentRuntime` when needed.
        *   For `createNip90JobRequest`, which requires `NIP04Service`:
            ```typescript
            const resolvedNip04Service = Context.get(currentRuntime.context, NIP04Service);
            const jobRequestWithNip04 = Effect.provideService(
              jobRequestEffect, // from createNip90JobRequest(...)
              NIP04Service,    // The Tag
              resolvedNip04Service // The live service from currentRuntime
            );
            // ...
            await Effect.runPromise(
              jobRequestWithNip04.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)) // This provide is for other services
            );
            ```
    *   For Nostr event subscription callbacks (inside `sub.on("event", async (event) => { ... })`):
        *   Call `const currentRuntimeForEvent = getMainRuntime();` at the start of the async callback.
        *   Resolve `NIP04Service` from `currentRuntimeForEvent` for decryption.
        *   Resolve `TelemetryService` from `currentRuntimeForEvent` for tracking.

5.  **Update `useEffect` in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` (main initialization/subscription effect):**
    *   Any Effect programs run within this `useEffect` (e.g., initial telemetry, setting up subscriptions) must use `getMainRuntime()` to fetch the current runtime and provide it.
    *   Example: `Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent(...)).pipe(Effect.provide(getMainRuntime()))`.

6.  **Remove `runtime` Prop from `Nip90ConsumerChatPane.tsx` and `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Modify `src/components/nip90_consumer_chat/Nip90ConsumerChatPane.tsx` to no longer pass the `runtime` prop to `useNip90ConsumerChat`. The hook will source its runtime internally.

7.  **Test Implementation (Crucial):**
    *   The test specified in `docs/logs/20250523/1052-payfail-newtests.md` (`src/tests/integration/runtime-reinitialization.test.ts`) is designed to catch exactly this type of stale runtime issue.
    *   **Action:** Implement this test file precisely as described if it's not already present or fully correct.
    *   **Verification:** Ensure this test passes after your fixes. It demonstrates that `getMainRuntime()` correctly retrieves the reinitialized runtime containing the user's actual `SparkService`.
    *   **Importance:** This test would have caught the payment failure by verifying that the `SparkService` instance used after `reinitializeRuntime` is different from the initial one.

**Verification Steps After Fix:**

*   **Primary:** Confirm that NIP-90 payments are now successfully sent from the consumer using the user's wallet after it has been initialized. The DVM provider should receive the payment and process the job.
*   **Telemetry Check (Consumer):** Observe new telemetry events:
    *   `nip90_consumer:payment` / `payment_start`
    *   `nip90_consumer:payment` / `payment_success` (or `payment_failure` if payment actually fails at SDK level)
*   **Telemetry Check (Provider):** `check_invoice_status_success` should now show `status: "paid"` for the DVM's invoice.
*   **Test `runtime-reinitialization.test.ts`:** Must pass.

By following these instructions, the NIP-90 consumer payment flow should be robust against runtime reinitializations, ensuring the correct `SparkService` instance is always used.Okay, Agent, the payment is still failing in the NIP-90 consumer flow, as confirmed by the telemetry in `docs/logs/20250523/1059-telemetry-payfail2-*.md`. The DVM (provider) correctly issues an invoice and waits, but the consumer (our app) isn't successfully making the payment, even though the user's wallet is initialized and funded.

2.  **Apply Stale Runtime Fix Pattern (as per `docs/fixes/023-effect-runtime-stale-references.md`):**
    *   **Remove Stored Runtime References:**
        *   Delete `const runtimeRef = useRef(getMainRuntime());`.
        *   Remove the `runtime` prop from `UseNip90ConsumerChatParams` interface and from the hook's function signature.
        *   Update the call site in `src/components/nip90_consumer_chat/Nip90ConsumerChatPane.tsx` to no longer pass the `runtime` prop.
        *   Remove `runtimeRef.current` (or the `runtime` prop if it was a dependency) from all `useCallback` and `useEffect` dependency arrays.
    *   **Dynamically Get Runtime in Callbacks/Effects:**
        *   In every asynchronous callback (`handlePayment`, `sendMessage`) and `useEffect` block that runs Effects:
            *   Call `const currentRuntime = getMainRuntime();` *inside* that callback/effect block to get the fresh, current runtime instance.
            *   Provide this `currentRuntime` instance to any `Effect.runPromise(...)`, `Effect.runPromiseExit(...)`, `Effect.runFork(...)`, or `Effect.provide(...)` calls.
        *   When resolving services (like `SparkService.Tag`, `NIP04Service.Tag`, `TelemetryService.Tag`) from context within these Effects (e.g., using `yield* _(ServiceTag)` in an `Effect.gen` block), ensure the outer Effect that contains this generator is provided with the `currentRuntime`.
        *   For helper functions like `createNip90JobRequest` that are Effects and require services (like `NIP04Service`):
            *   Resolve the required service (e.g., `NIP04Service`) from the `currentRuntime` using `Context.get(currentRuntime.context, NIP04Service)`.
            *   Provide this resolved service instance to the helper Effect using `Effect.provideService(helperEffect, ServiceTag, resolvedServiceInstance)`.

3.  **Update `handlePayment` in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Ensure it gets `const currentRuntime = getMainRuntime();` at the beginning of the callback.
    *   The `payEffect` should use `SparkService.Tag` and `TelemetryService.Tag` (which will be resolved from `currentRuntime` when `payEffect.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime))` is called).
    *   **Add Missing Telemetry:**
        *   Inside `payEffect`, before calling `spark.payLightningInvoice`, track a `payment_start` event:
            ```typescript
            yield* telemetry.trackEvent({
              category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
              action: "payment_start",
              label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`, // Assuming jobId is available
              value: `Invoice: ${invoice.substring(0,30)}... Amount: ${paymentState.amountSats || 'unknown'} sats`
            });
            ```
        *   On successful payment (e.g., inside `if (Exit.isSuccess(paymentExit))` block, after confirming success), track a `payment_success` event using the `currentRuntime` from the `handlePayment` scope:
            ```typescript
            Effect.runFork(
              Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent({
                category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
                action: "payment_success",
                label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`, // Assuming jobId is available
                value: paymentResult.paymentHash // Assuming paymentResult is available
              })).pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime))
            );
            ```
        *   On payment failure (e.g., inside the `else` block for `Exit.isFailure`), track a `payment_failure` event similarly:
            ```typescript
            Effect.runFork(
              Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent({
                category: "nip90_consumer:payment",
                action: "payment_failure",
                label: `Job ID: ${jobId}`, // Assuming jobId is available
                value: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error) // Assuming error is available
              })).pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime))
            );
            ```

4.  **Update `sendMessage` in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Fetch `const currentRuntime = getMainRuntime();` at the start of the `sendMessage` callback.
    *   Resolve `TelemetryService.Tag` using `const telemetry = Context.get(currentRuntime.context, TelemetryService);` for immediate use.
    *   For the `jobRequestEffect` (created by `createNip90JobRequest`):
        *   Resolve `NIP04Service.Tag`: `const resolvedNip04Service = Context.get(currentRuntime.context, NIP04Service);`
        *   Provide it: `const jobRequestWithNip04 = Effect.provideService(jobRequestEffect, NIP04Service, resolvedNip04Service);`
        *   Run it: `Effect.runPromise(jobRequestWithNip04.pipe(Effect.provide(currentRuntime)));`
    *   Inside the Nostr event subscription callback (`sub.on("event", async (event) => { ... })`):
        *   Call `const currentRuntimeForEvent = getMainRuntime();` at the start of this inner async callback.
        *   Resolve `TelemetryService.Tag` and `NIP04Service.Tag` from `currentRuntimeForEvent` for operations within this specific event handler.

5.  **Update `useEffect` (main initialization/subscription effect) in `src/hooks/useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`:**
    *   Any Effect programs run within this `useEffect` (e.g., initial telemetry, setting up Nostr subscriptions) must fetch and use `getMainRuntime()` for their context.
    *   Example: `Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent(...)).pipe(Effect.provide(getMainRuntime()))`.

6.  **Test Implementation (`docs/logs/20250523/1052-payfail-newtests.md`):**
    *   **Ensure `src/tests/integration/runtime-reinitialization.test.ts` is implemented precisely as described in the `1052-payfail-newtests.md` document.** This test is critical for verifying that `getMainRuntime()` correctly fetches the latest runtime instance after `reinitializeRuntime()` is called.
    *   **Run this test and ensure it passes.** This test specifically targets the stale runtime issue. If this test had been in place and passing, the current payment failure would likely have been prevented or caught much earlier.

**Verification Steps After Fix:**

*   **Primary:** Confirm that NIP-90 payments are now successfully sent from the consumer using the user's actual wallet *after* it has been initialized (e.g., by entering a seed phrase). The DVM provider should receive the payment and proceed to process the job.
*   **Telemetry Check (Consumer):** The telemetry log (`telemetry-payfail2-consumer.md`) should now show the following event sequence for a successful payment:
    *   `nip90_consumer:payment` / `payment_start`
    *   `nip90_consumer:payment` / `payment_success`
*   **Telemetry Check (Provider):** The DVM's `checkInvoiceStatus` should eventually show the invoice as "paid" (e.g., `spark:lightning` / `check_invoice_status_success`, label: 'Invoice status: paid').
*   **Test `runtime-reinitialization.test.ts`:** This test (from `1052-payfail-newtests.md`) **MUST** pass.

By meticulously applying this "fresh runtime" pattern, especially within `handlePayment` and other Effect-executing callbacks in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts`, the payment failure should be resolved.
