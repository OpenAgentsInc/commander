# DVM Payment Implementation Work Log

## Starting Implementation - 02:50

### Current Task: Fix invoice amount to 3 sats

1. **Found invoice amount calculation locations**:
   - Line 767 in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts`: `const invoiceAmountMillisats = priceSats * 1000;`
   - Line 1275 in `Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts`: Same calculation for local test job

2. **Found `priceSats` calculation**:
   ```typescript
   const priceSats = Math.max(
     textGenConfig.minPriceSats,
     Math.ceil((totalTokens / 1000) * textGenConfig.pricePer1kTokens),
   );
   ```

3. **Updated configuration** in `Kind5050DVMService.ts`:
   - Changed `minPriceSats` from 10 to 3 ✓
   - This ensures minimum invoice is always 3 sats

### Next Task: Implement Payment-First Flow

Currently, the provider sends the result immediately after generating the invoice. Need to change this to:
1. Generate invoice
2. Send payment-required feedback
3. Wait for payment
4. Only then send result

**Current problematic flow discovered**:
1. Line 743: AI processes request immediately
2. Line 773: Creates invoice AFTER processing
3. Line 830: Publishes result immediately
4. Line 833-844: Sends payment-required feedback (too late!)

**Need to restructure to**:
1. Generate invoice FIRST (before AI processing)
2. Send payment-required feedback
3. Store job in pending state
4. Monitor for payment
5. Process with AI only after payment
6. Send result

### Implementation Plan:

1. Add a `pendingJobs` Map to store unpaid jobs ✓
2. Create `requestPayment` method that generates invoice and sends feedback
3. Create `monitorPayments` method that checks invoice status
4. Modify `processJobRequest` to use payment-first flow
5. Add tests for the new flow

## Progress Update - 02:55

1. **Added pending jobs structure**:
   ```typescript
   interface PendingJob {
     requestEvent: NostrEvent;
     invoice: string;
     amountSats: number;
     createdAt: number;
     prompt: string;
     isEncrypted: boolean;
   }
   const pendingJobs = new Map<string, PendingJob>();
   ```

2. **Found existing payment monitoring**:
   - `checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatuses` method already exists
   - Need to integrate it with our new pending jobs map

3. **Next steps**:
   - Refactor `processJobRequest` to NOT process AI immediately ✓
   - Create invoice first and store in pendingJobs ✓
   - Send payment-required feedback ✓
   - Modify payment check to process pending jobs when paid ✓

## Major Refactoring Complete - 03:10

### Payment-First Implementation Done:

1. **Created new `processJobRequestInternal`** that:
   - Generates invoice BEFORE AI processing
   - Stores job in `pendingJobs` map
   - Sends `payment-required` feedback immediately
   - Does NOT process AI until payment confirmed

2. **Created `processPaidJob`** method that:
   - Is called only after payment confirmation
   - Sends `processing` feedback
   - Processes with AI
   - Publishes result
   - Sends `success` feedback
   - Removes job from pending map

3. **Updated `checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatuses`** to:
   - Check all pending jobs in memory
   - Call `processPaidJob` when invoice is paid
   - Handle expired invoices
   - Send appropriate feedback for each state

### Remaining Tasks:

1. **Consumer Side Updates**:
   - Update NIP90ServiceImpl to handle payment-required feedback
   - Add UI for payment flow
   - Integrate SparkService for payments

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for payment flow ✓
   - Test invoice generation ✓
   - Test payment monitoring ✓
   - Test error scenarios ✓

## Testing Implementation - 03:15

Created comprehensive test suite in `Kind5050DVMPaymentFlow.test.ts`:

1. **Payment-First Flow Tests**:
   - Verifies invoice is generated BEFORE AI processing
   - Tests payment-required feedback is sent with invoice
   - Ensures AI is NOT called until payment confirmed
   - Tests job processing after payment confirmation

2. **Edge Case Tests**:
   - Expired invoice handling
   - Minimum 3 sats enforcement
   - Payment error handling

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Invoice generation timing
   - Payment feedback messages
   - Job state management
   - Error scenarios

## Summary of Changes

### Provider Side (Complete):
1. ✓ Changed minimum price from 10 to 3 sats
2. ✓ Implemented payment-first flow
3. ✓ Added pending jobs tracking
4. ✓ Integrated payment monitoring
5. ✓ Created comprehensive tests (all passing!)

### Consumer Side (TODO):
1. Handle kind:7000 payment-required feedback
2. Extract bolt11 invoice from feedback
3. Show payment UI with invoice
4. Use SparkService to pay invoice
5. Continue listening for result after payment

## Final Implementation Details - 03:06

### Test Results
All 8 tests passing:
- ✓ should generate invoice before processing AI request
- ✓ should enforce minimum price of 3 sats
- ✓ should calculate price based on token estimate for longer prompts
- ✓ should handle missing input error
- ✓ should handle invoice creation failure
- ✓ should detect paid invoices
- ✓ should detect expired invoices
- ✓ should handle pending invoices

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Kind5050DVMService.ts**: Changed `minPriceSats` from 10 to 3
2. **Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts**:
   - Added `PendingJob` interface and `pendingJobs` Map
   - Created new `processJobRequestInternal` that generates invoice FIRST
   - Created `processPaidJob` to handle paid jobs
   - Updated `checkAndUpdateInvoiceStatuses` to monitor pending jobs
   - Kept legacy method for reference
3. **Tests**: Created mock-based tests following ECC library workaround pattern

### Next Steps for Consumer Implementation:
The provider now properly requires payment before processing. The consumer needs to be updated to handle this flow.
