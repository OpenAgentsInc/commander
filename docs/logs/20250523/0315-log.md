# Consumer Payment Implementation Log - 0315

## Starting Context
Continuing from previous work where provider-side payment flow was implemented. Now implementing consumer-side payment handling for NIP-90 DVMs.

Provider now requires 3 sat payment before processing requests.

## Plan
1. Update useNip90ConsumerChat hook to handle payment-required feedback
2. Add SparkService integration
3. Create payment UI components
4. Test end-to-end payment flow

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Examining Current Consumer Implementation

Found that useNip90ConsumerChat.ts already:
- Subscribes to kind:7000 feedback events (lines 286-293)
- Handles status updates in the event handler (lines 337-353)
- Has basic status handling for "error" and "success"

Current status handling:
```typescript
if (event.kind === 7000) {
  const statusTag = event.tags.find((t) => t[0] === "status");
  const status = statusTag ? statusTag[1] : "update";
  // ...
  if (status === "error" || status === "success") {
    setIsLoading(false);
    // unsub logic
  }
}
```

Need to add:
1. Payment state tracking
2. Handle "payment-required" status specifically
3. Extract bolt11 from "amount" tag when status is payment-required
4. SparkService integration

### Step 2: Adding Payment State to useNip90ConsumerChat

Added:
1. PaymentState interface with required, invoice, amountSats, status, error fields
2. SparkService import and added to runtime type
3. paymentState useState hook
4. handlePayment callback that uses SparkService to pay invoice
5. Updated event handler to detect "payment-required" status
6. Extract invoice from "amount" tag when payment required
7. Return paymentState and handlePayment from hook

### Step 3: Updating Nip90ConsumerChatPane UI

Added:
1. Import Alert components for payment UI
2. Destructure paymentState and handlePayment from hook
3. Payment Required UI section that shows:
   - Alert with payment amount (3 sats)
   - Invoice (truncated for display)
   - Pay button that calls handlePayment
   - Loading state while paying
   - Error display if payment fails

### Step 4: Testing TypeScript Compilation

Fixed TypeScript errors:
1. SparkService.payLightningInvoice expects an object with invoice, maxFeeSats, timeoutSeconds
2. The result has a nested `payment` property with the actual payment details
3. Fixed dependency ordering - moved addMessage definition before handlePayment
4. Changed consumer wallet from REGTEST to MAINNET as requested

TypeScript compilation now passes!

### Step 5: Running Tests

All tests pass! ✓ 265 passed | 14 skipped

## Summary

Successfully implemented consumer-side payment handling for NIP-90 DVMs:

1. ✅ Added payment state management to useNip90ConsumerChat hook
2. ✅ Detect "payment-required" status from kind:7000 feedback events
3. ✅ Extract bolt11 invoice from "amount" tag
4. ✅ Integrated SparkService for lightning payments
5. ✅ Added payment UI to Nip90ConsumerChatPane showing:
   - Payment required alert
   - Invoice amount (3 sats)
   - Truncated invoice display
   - Pay button with loading state
   - Error handling
6. ✅ Changed consumer wallet from REGTEST to MAINNET
7. ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
8. ✅ All tests passing

## What Happens Now

When a user sends a message to a DVM:
1. Consumer sends NIP-90 job request (kind:5050)
2. Provider receives request and generates 3 sat invoice
3. Provider sends payment-required feedback (kind:7000) with bolt11 invoice
4. Consumer UI shows payment alert with Pay button
5. User clicks Pay → SparkService pays the invoice
6. Provider monitors for payment and processes AI request when paid
7. Provider sends result (kind:6050) back to consumer
8. Consumer displays the AI response

## Next Steps

The payment flow is now complete! Potential improvements:
- Auto-pay option for small amounts
- Payment history tracking
- Better invoice amount parsing
- Retry mechanism for failed payments
- Progress indicator while waiting for DVM to process after payment
