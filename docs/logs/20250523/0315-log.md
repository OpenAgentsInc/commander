# Consumer Payment Implementation Log - 0315

## Starting Context
Continuing from previous work where provider-side payment flow was implemented. Now implementing consumer-side payment handling for NIP-90 DVMs.

Provider now requires 3 sat payment before processing requests.

## Plan
1. Update useNip90ConsumerChat hook to handle payment-required feedback
2. Add SparkService integration
3. Create payment UI components
4. Test end-to-end payment flow

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Examining Current Consumer Implementation

Found that useNip90ConsumerChat.ts already:
- Subscribes to kind:7000 feedback events (lines 286-293)
- Handles status updates in the event handler (lines 337-353)
- Has basic status handling for "error" and "success"

Current status handling:
```typescript
if (event.kind === 7000) {
  const statusTag = event.tags.find((t) => t[0] === "status");
  const status = statusTag ? statusTag[1] : "update";
  // ...
  if (status === "error" || status === "success") {
    setIsLoading(false);
    // unsub logic
  }
}
```

Need to add:
1. Payment state tracking
2. Handle "payment-required" status specifically
3. Extract bolt11 from "amount" tag when status is payment-required
4. SparkService integration

### Step 2: Adding Payment State to useNip90ConsumerChat

Added:
1. PaymentState interface with required, invoice, amountSats, status, error fields
2. SparkService import and added to runtime type
3. paymentState useState hook
4. handlePayment callback that uses SparkService to pay invoice
5. Updated event handler to detect "payment-required" status
6. Extract invoice from "amount" tag when payment required
7. Return paymentState and handlePayment from hook

### Step 3: Updating Nip90ConsumerChatPane UI

Added:
1. Import Alert components for payment UI
2. Destructure paymentState and handlePayment from hook
3. Payment Required UI section that shows:
   - Alert with payment amount (3 sats)
   - Invoice (truncated for display)
   - Pay button that calls handlePayment
   - Loading state while paying
   - Error display if payment fails

### Step 4: Testing TypeScript Compilation

Fixed TypeScript errors:
1. SparkService.payLightningInvoice expects an object with invoice, maxFeeSats, timeoutSeconds
2. The result has a nested `payment` property with the actual payment details
3. Fixed dependency ordering - moved addMessage definition before handlePayment
4. Changed consumer wallet from REGTEST to MAINNET as requested

TypeScript compilation now passes!

### Step 5: Running Tests
