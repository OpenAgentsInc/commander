The payment handshake is still not working due to the NIP-90 consumer (the application when requesting a DVM job) not receiving or processing the "payment-required" (Kind 7000) event from the DVM (the provider). This breaks the NIP-90 payment flow before any payment attempt is made by the consumer.

**Analysis of Telemetry #4 (`1131-telemetry-payfail4-*.md` logs):**

1.  **Consumer Side (`1131-telemetry-payfail4-consumer.md`):**
    *   The consumer's wallet is correctly initialized with 500 sats.
    *   The user sends a message ("Test") via the `AgentChatPane`, configured to use the `nip90_devstral` provider.
    *   The `ChatOrchestratorService` correctly resolves and builds the `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive` for this provider.
    *   The `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive` successfully creates and publishes the NIP-90 job request (Kind 5050, ID `a19fa3b1f5...`).
    *   It then subscribes to job updates (Kind 6050 for results, Kind 7000 for feedback) related to this job ID. The subscription is created successfully on relays: `wss://relay.damus.io/`, `wss://relay.snort.social/`, `wss://nos.lol/`.
    *   **Crucially, the consumer log ENDS here for this job.** There are no subsequent telemetry events indicating:
        *   Receipt of a Kind 7000 "payment-required" event from the DVM.
        *   Triggering of the auto-payment logic.
        *   Any payment attempt (`payment_attempt`, `payment_start`, etc.).

2.  **Provider Side (DVM - `1131-telemetry-payfail4-provider.md`):**
    *   The DVM is online and listening.
    *   It successfully receives the job request (ID `a19fa3b1f5...`, Kind 5050) from the consumer.
    *   It correctly calculates the price (3 sats) and creates a Lightning invoice (`lnbc30n1p5rpg43pp5f0...`).
    *   It logs `dvm:job` / `payment_requested` and `job_pending_payment`, indicating it has generated the invoice and is ready to send feedback.
    *   It attempts to publish the Kind 7000 "payment-required" feedback event (`b28f8eaf64ed...`).
    *   The publish result is a `nostr_publish_partial_failure`: "1 succeeded, 2 failed. Failures: Error: pow: 28 bits needed. (2), Error: no active subscription". This means the Kind 7000 event was successfully published to *one* of its configured relays, but failed on two others.
    *   The DVM's configured relays (from `defaultKind5050DVMServiceConfig`) are `wss://relay.damus.io`, `wss://relay.nostr.band`, `wss://nos.lol`.

**Root Cause: Relay Mismatch for Subscription vs. Publish**

The consumer subscribes to job updates (including Kind 7000 feedback) on `damus`, `snort.social`, and `nos.lol`. These are the default relays configured for the `NostrService` (via `DefaultNostrServiceConfigLayer` in `src/services/nostr/NostrService.ts`).

The DVM provider publishes its Kind 7000 feedback event to its configured relays: `damus`, `nostr.band`, and `nos.lol`.

The "partial failure" on the DVM's publish means it likely succeeded on one of these three.
If the successful publish was to `relay.nostr.band`, the consumer would **miss** this event because it's not subscribed to `relay.nostr.band` for these specific DVM updates. It's listening on `relay.snort.social` instead for that slot.

The `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.streamText` method (which handles consuming DVM responses) calls `nip90Service.subscribeToJobUpdates`. This, in turn, calls `nostrService.subscribeToEvents` without specifying custom relays, so it uses the default Nostr relays.

However, for a specific DVM interaction (like one initiated via `nip90_devstral` provider), the consumer should subscribe to the *DVM's configured relays* (from `NIP90ProviderConfig.dvmRelays`) to ensure it receives events published by that DVM.

**Specific Coding Instructions to Fix:**

1.  **Modify `NIP90Service` Interface (`src/services/nip90/NIP90Service.ts`):**
    *   Update the `subscribeToJobUpdates` method signature to accept an optional `relays` parameter.
    ```typescript
    export interface NIP90Service {
      // ... other methods ...
      subscribeToJobUpdates(
        jobRequestEventId: string,
        dvmPubkeyHex: string,
        decryptionKey: Uint8Array,
        onUpdate: (event: NIP90JobResult | NIP90JobFeedback) => void,
        relays?: readonly string[], // <<< ADD THIS PARAMETER
      ): Effect.Effect<
        Subscription,
        NostrRequestError | NIP04DecryptError | NIP90ResultError,
        never // R = never, dependencies are handled by the Live layer
      >;
      // ... other methods ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Modify `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` (`src/services/nip90/NIP90ServiceImpl.ts`):**
    *   Update the `subscribeToJobUpdates` implementation to accept and use the `customRelays` parameter when calling `nostr.subscribeToEvents`.

    ```typescript
    // Inside NIP90ServiceLive Layer.effect(...)
    // ...
    subscribeToJobUpdates: (
      jobRequestEventId,
      dvmPubkeyHex,
      decryptionKey,
      onUpdate,
      customRelays, // <<< NEW PARAMETER
    ) => Effect.gen(function* (_) {
      // ... (telemetry and filter setup remain the same) ...
      const resultFilter: NostrFilter = { /* ... */ };
      const feedbackFilter: NostrFilter = { /* ... */ };

      const subscription = yield* _(
        nostr.subscribeToEvents(
          [resultFilter, feedbackFilter],
          (event) => {
            // ... (event processing logic remains the same) ...
          },
          customRelays, // <<< PASS customRelays TO nostr.subscribeToEvents
        ),
      );
      return subscription;
    }),
    // ...
    ```

3.  **Modify `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.streamText` (`src/services/ai/providers/nip90/NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`):**
    *   When calling `nip90Service.subscribeToJobUpdates`, pass the `dvmConfig.dvmRelays` as the new `relays` argument.

    ```typescript
    // Inside NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive Layer.effect(...)
    // In the streamText method, after creating and publishing `signedEvent`:
    // ...
    const dvmConfig = yield* _(NIP90ProviderConfigTag); // Ensure dvmConfig is available
    // ...
    // (requesterSk and dvmPubkey should be correctly derived/available here)
    // ...

    const sub = yield* _(
      nip90Service.subscribeToJobUpdates(
        signedEvent.id,
        dvmPubkey,       // This must be the target DVM's pubkey
        requesterSk,     // The ephemeral SK used for this request
        (eventData) => { // The callback that pushes to the Effect Queue
          Effect.runFork(Effect.flatMap(TelemetryService, ts => ts.trackEvent(/* ... */))); // For debug
          if (eventData.kind === 7000) { // Feedback
            // ... (existing logic to handle status and payment) ...
            // Map to AiResponse or specific chunk type for the stream
            const feedbackAiResponse = AiResponse.fromSimple({ text: `Feedback: ${eventData.status} - ${eventData.content}` });
            Effect.runFork(Queue.offer(queue, feedbackAiResponse));
          } else if (eventData.kind >= 6000 && eventData.kind < 7000) { // Result
            // ... (existing logic to handle result) ...
            const resultAiResponse = AiResponse.fromSimple({ text: eventData.content || "Job completed." });
            Effect.runFork(Queue.offer(queue, resultAiResponse));
            Effect.runFork(Queue.shutdown(queue)); // End stream on final result
          }
        },
        dvmConfig.dvmRelays, // <<< PASS THE DVM-SPECIFIC RELAYS HERE
      ),
    );
    // ... (rest of stream setup using the queue) ...
    ```
    Ensure `dvmPubkey` used in `subscribeToJobUpdates` is correctly the `dvmConfig.dvmPubkey` (the target DVM's public key), and `requesterSk` is the ephemeral secret key used to sign the job request (if `useEphemeralRequests` is true in `dvmConfig`, otherwise it's the user's main Nostr SK).

**Reasoning for the Fix:**

By making these changes, the `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive` (acting as the consumer) will subscribe for job updates specifically on the relays that the target DVM (`dvmConfig.dvmRelays`) is expected to use. This significantly increases the chance of receiving the Kind 7000 "payment-required" event, which is the current blocker for the payment handshake.

The DVM's "partial failure" to publish to all its relays is a separate issue that might need addressing (e.g., by implementing PoW or improving relay connection robustness in `NostrService`), but ensuring the consumer listens on the DVM's known good relays is the most direct fix for the handshake failure.

**After Applying This Fix:**
The consumer should now receive the "payment-required" event, the auto-pay logic (for amounts <= 10 sats) in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` should trigger `handlePayment`, and you should see "payment_attempt" and subsequent payment telemetry events in the consumer log. This will allow the payment handshake to proceed.The payment handshake is still failing because the NIP-90 consumer (your application) is **not receiving or processing the "payment-required" (Kind 7000) event** from the DVM (the provider).

**Analysis of Telemetry #4 (`1131-telemetry-payfail4-*.md` logs):**

1.  **Consumer Side (`1131-telemetry-payfail4-consumer.md`):**
    *   The consumer's wallet initializes correctly with 500 sats.
    *   The user sends a message ("Test") using the `nip90_devstral` provider.
    *   The `ChatOrchestratorService` resolves the `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive`.
    *   A NIP-90 job request (Kind 5050, ID `a19fa3b1f5...`) is successfully created and published.
    *   A subscription is successfully created to listen for updates (Kind 6050 for results, Kind 7000 for feedback) related to job `a19fa3b1f5...`.
    *   The consumer subscribes on these relays: `wss://relay.damus.io/`, `wss://relay.snort.social/`, `wss://nos.lol/`.
    *   **Crucially, no "payment-required" (Kind 7000) event is logged as received by the consumer for job `a19fa3b1f5...`.** This means the auto-payment logic in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` (or its equivalent in `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive`) is never triggered.

2.  **Provider Side (DVM - `1131-telemetry-payfail4-provider.md`):**
    *   The DVM (provider) receives the job request (ID `a19fa3b1f5...`).
    *   It creates a Lightning invoice (3 sats, `lnbc30n1p5rpg43pp5f0...`).
    *   It logs `dvm:job` / `payment_requested` and `job_pending_payment`.
    *   It attempts to publish the Kind 7000 "payment-required" feedback event (`b28f8eaf64ed...`).
    *   The publish result is a `nostr_publish_partial_failure`: "1 succeeded, 2 failed." The DVM is configured to use relays: `wss://relay.damus.io`, `wss://relay.nostr.band`, `wss://nos.lol`.

**Root Cause: Relay Mismatch and Publish Failure**

The consumer is not receiving the "payment-required" event due to a mismatch in the relays it's listening on versus where the DVM successfully published the event.

*   **Consumer Subscription Relays (for job `a19fa...` updates):** `damus`, `snort.social`, `nos.lol`. (These are the default relays from `NostrServiceConfigTag` in `NostrServiceImpl.ts`).
*   **DVM Publishing Relays (for the Kind 7000 feedback):** `damus`, `nostr.band`, `nos.lol`. (These are from `useDVMSettingsStore.getState().getEffectiveConfig().relays` which defaults to `defaultKind5050DVMServiceConfig.relays`).

The DVM's Kind 7000 event was published successfully to **one** of its three relays. If this successful publish was to `relay.nostr.band`, the consumer (who is not listening to `nostr.band` for these updates, but to `snort.social` instead) would miss the event.

**Specific Coding Instructions to Fix:**

The consumer, when subscribing to updates for a specific DVM job, should subscribe to the relays configured for that DVM provider, not just the global default Nostr relays.

1.  **Modify `NIP90Service` Interface (`src/services/nip90/NIP90Service.ts`):**
    *   Update the `subscribeToJobUpdates` method to accept an optional `relays` parameter.
    ```typescript
    // src/services/nip90/NIP90Service.ts
    export interface NIP90Service {
      // ... other methods ...
      subscribeToJobUpdates(
        jobRequestEventId: string,
        dvmPubkeyHex: string, // DVM's pubkey
        decryptionKey: Uint8Array, // Requester's SK (ephemeral or main) for decrypting
        onUpdate: (event: NIP90JobResult | NIP90JobFeedback) => void,
        relays?: readonly string[], // <<< ADD THIS PARAMETER for target relays
      ): Effect.Effect<
        Subscription,
        NostrRequestError | NIP04DecryptError | NIP90ResultError,
        never // R = never, dependencies are handled by the Live layer
      >;
      // ... other methods ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Modify `NIP90ServiceImpl.ts` (`src/services/nip90/NIP90ServiceImpl.ts`):**
    *   Update the `subscribeToJobUpdates` implementation to use the passed `customRelays` when calling `nostr.subscribeToEvents`.

    ```typescript
    // src/services/nip90/NIP90ServiceImpl.ts
    // Inside NIP90ServiceLive Layer.effect(...)
    // ...
    subscribeToJobUpdates: (
      jobRequestEventId,
      dvmPubkeyHex,
      decryptionKey,
      onUpdate,
      customRelays, // <<< NEW PARAMETER
    ) => Effect.gen(function* (_) {
      yield* _( /* ... telemetry ... */ );

      const resultFilter: NostrFilter = {
        kinds: Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => 6000 + i),
        "#e": [jobRequestEventId],
        authors: [dvmPubkeyHex],
        // since: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 300, // Consider a reasonable since filter
        limit: 5, // Limit initial fetch
      };
      const feedbackFilter: NostrFilter = {
        kinds: [7000],
        "#e": [jobRequestEventId],
        authors: [dvmPubkeyHex],
        // since: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 300,
        limit: 10,
      };

      const subscription = yield* _(
        nostr.subscribeToEvents(
          [resultFilter, feedbackFilter],
          (event: NostrEvent) => {
            // ... (existing event processing logic for decryption and calling onUpdate) ...
          },
          customRelays, // <<< PASS customRelays TO nostr.subscribeToEvents
                        // NostrServiceImpl's subscribeToEvents will use these if provided,
                        // otherwise its own default relays.
        ),
      );
      return subscription;
    }),
    // ...
    ```

3.  **Modify `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.streamText` (`src/services/ai/providers/nip90/NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`):**
    *   When calling `nip90Service.subscribeToJobUpdates`, pass the `dvmConfig.dvmRelays`.

    ```typescript
    // src/services/ai/providers/nip90/NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts
    // Inside the streamText method, after creating and publishing `signedEvent`:
    // ...
    const dvmConfig = yield* _(NIP90ProviderConfigTag); // This holds the DVM's specific config
    const requesterSk = // ... (ensure this is the correct SK, ephemeral or main)
    const targetDvmPubkey = dvmConfig.dvmPubkey; // This is the DVM we are talking to

    const sub = yield* _(
      nip90Service.subscribeToJobUpdates(
        signedEvent.id,
        targetDvmPubkey,
        requesterSk,
        (eventData: NIP90JobResult | NIP90JobFeedback) => {
          // ... (existing logic to push to Effect.Queue) ...
        },
        dvmConfig.dvmRelays, // <<< PASS THE DVM-SPECIFIC RELAYS HERE
      ),
    );
    // ...
    ```

**Justification:**
This ensures that when the `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive` (acting as the consumer for a specific DVM like `nip90_devstral`) subscribes to job updates, it listens on the same relays the DVM is configured to publish its responses and feedback to. This directly addresses the most probable cause of the missed "payment-required" event.

**Secondary Consideration (Provider-Side Publish Reliability):**
The DVM's "partial failure" to publish the Kind 7000 event is also a concern. While the above fix should allow the consumer to receive the event if it was published to *any* common relay, improving the DVM's publish reliability (e.g., handling PoW requirements, better relay connection management in `NostrService`) would be a good follow-up to make the system more robust overall. For now, focusing on the consumer's subscription alignment is key.
