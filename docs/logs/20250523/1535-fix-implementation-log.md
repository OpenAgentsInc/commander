# NIP-90 Payment Failure Fix Implementation Log

## Starting at 15:35

### Task: Fix three critical bugs preventing NIP-90 payment verification

1. **SparkService payment status misreporting** - SDK doesn't return status field
2. **NostrService only uses first filter** - Missing Kind 7000 feedback events  
3. **Payment hash vs preimage confusion** - Wrong field extraction

### Implementation Plan
1. Fix SparkService payment status logic
2. Fix NostrService to handle multiple filters
3. Fix payment hash extraction
4. Test the fixes

## Fix 1: SparkService Payment Status Logic ✅ COMPLETED

### Current Issue
- Code checks `sdkResult.status` which is undefined
- `String(undefined)` becomes "undefined" 
- Doesn't contain "SUCCESS" so defaults to "FAILED"
- But payment actually succeeds (balance decreases correctly)

### Implementation 
**File**: `src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts:527-535`

**Change**: Replaced SDK status checking with presence-based detection:
- If `paymentPreimage` exists → "SUCCESS" 
- If `error` or `failure` exists → "FAILED"
- Otherwise → "PENDING"

**Reasoning**: SDK doesn't return a `status` field, but `paymentPreimage` is only present when payment succeeds.

## Fix 2: NostrService Multiple Filter Support ✅ COMPLETED

### Current Issue
- `listEvents` only uses `filters[0]` 
- Missing Kind 7000 feedback events needed for payment verification
- Provider can't see successful payments

### Implementation  
**File**: `src/services/nostr/NostrServiceImpl.ts:102-134`

**Change**: 
- Loop through all filters instead of just first one
- Query each filter separately with same timeout/error handling
- Combine results and deduplicate by event ID
- Maintains existing telemetry and error handling

---

## Fix 3: Payment Hash Extraction ✅ COMPLETED

### Current Issue
- Using `paymentPreimage` as `paymentHash`
- These are different Lightning Network concepts
- Results in "unknown-hash" when preimage missing

### Implementation
**File**: `src/services/spark/SparkServiceImpl.ts:508-513`

**Change**: Try multiple possible hash fields:
1. `sdkResult.paymentHash` 
2. `sdkResult.hash`
3. `sdkResult.paymentPreimage` (fallback)
4. "unknown-hash" (last resort)
