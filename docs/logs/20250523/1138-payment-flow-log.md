# Payment Flow Implementation Log

Starting implementation of payment flow fix based on analysis document.

## Analysis Review

The issue is that payment handling logic exists in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` but the actual user flow goes through:
1. AgentChatPane → useAgentChat hook
2. ChatOrchestratorService 
3. NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive

The `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts` file has no payment handling for `status === "payment-required"` events.

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Read analysis document
2. ⏳ Edit `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts` to add payment handling
3. ⏳ Edit `ChatOrchestratorService.ts` to provide SparkService
4. ⏳ Test and verify

## Step 1: Editing NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts

✅ **COMPLETED** - Added payment handling logic to NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts

### Changes made:
1. **Added imports**: SparkService and getMainRuntime
2. **Added service dependency**: `const sparkService = yield* _(SparkService);` 
3. **Added payment-required handler** in the eventUpdate callback (line ~278)
   - Extracts invoice from amount tag
   - Auto-pays amounts ≤ 10 sats
   - Comprehensive telemetry tracking:
     - `payment_required` event when DVM requests payment
     - `auto_payment_triggered` when auto-pay starts  
     - `payment_success` or `payment_error` for result
   - Emits status updates to chat stream
   - Error handling with proper AiProviderError

## Step 2: Editing ChatOrchestratorService.ts

✅ **COMPLETED** - Added SparkService dependency to NIP90 provider layer

### Changes made:
1. **Added import**: SparkService from "@/services/spark"
2. **Added service dependency**: `const sparkService = yield* _(SparkService);`
3. **Added to Layer.provide chain**: `Layer.provide(Layer.succeed(SparkService, sparkService))`

## Step 3: Testing the implementation

✅ **SYNTAX FIXED** - Resolved async/await and yield* scope issues

### Issues fixed:
1. **Changed callback to async**: `(eventUpdate) => {` → `async (eventUpdate) => {`
2. **Removed yield* from callback**: Can't use Effect generators inside async callbacks
3. **Used Effect.runFork for telemetry**: Fire-and-forget for non-blocking telemetry
4. **Used Effect.runPromise for payment**: Async execution with .then/.catch handlers

### Current status:
- ✅ TypeScript syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Payment logic implemented in correct location (NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts)
- ✅ SparkService properly provided to NIP90 layer
- ⚠️ ECC library test issue exists (unrelated to our changes)

## Implementation Summary

The payment failure fix has been successfully implemented:

### What was fixed:
1. **Root cause**: Payment handling was in `useNip90ConsumerChat.ts` but actual user flow goes through `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts`
2. **Solution**: Added payment-required handler directly in the NIP90 subscription callback
3. **Auto-payment**: Automatically pays amounts ≤ 10 sats without user approval
4. **User feedback**: Emits status messages to chat stream showing payment progress
5. **Telemetry**: Comprehensive tracking of payment events for debugging

### Key changes:
- **NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive.ts**: Added payment-required status handler
- **ChatOrchestratorService.ts**: Added SparkService dependency to NIP90 provider layer

### Expected behavior:
When a DVM requests payment:
1. **Telemetry logged**: `payment_required` event 
2. **Auto-payment triggered**: For amounts ≤ 10 sats
3. **User sees progress**: "Auto-paid 3 sats. Payment hash: abc123... Waiting for DVM to process..."
4. **Payment tracked**: Success/error events in telemetry
5. **DVM continues processing**: After receiving payment

The fix is ready for testing with real DVM interactions.
