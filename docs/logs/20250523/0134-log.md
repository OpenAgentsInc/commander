# NIP90 DVM Investigation Log

**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Time**: 01:34  
**Issue**: Consumer receives "I can't decrypt this message" response, but provider shows no event reception  

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The decryption error message "I can't decrypt this message without the correct private key" is NOT in our codebase. This confirms that:
1. The response is coming from another DVM on the network
2. Our provider (monitored in telemetry) is NOT receiving the events
3. The p-tag configuration fix worked - but our provider still isn't seeing events

## Investigation Results

### 1. Decryption Error Message Source
- **Searched entire codebase**: No matches for "I can't decrypt this message without the correct private key"
- **Confirmed**: This is an ACTUAL response from a DVM on the network
- **Implication**: Another DVM is responding to our job requests

### 2. Provider Event Reception Analysis

#### Provider Subscription Filter (Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts:952-958)
```typescript
const filters: NostrFilter[] = [
  {
    kinds: supportedKinds,
    "#p": [dvmPublicKeyHex],
    since: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 60, // Last minute only
  },
];
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: The provider has a `since` filter that only looks for events from the last 60 seconds!

#### Provider Event Handler (Kind5050DVMServiceImpl.ts:982-996)
```typescript
const onEvent = (event: NostrEvent) => {
  if (isActiveInternal) {
    Effect.runFork(
      telemetry.trackEvent({
        category: "dvm:event",
        action: "received_job_request",
        label: event.id,
        value: `Kind: ${event.kind}`,
      }).pipe(Effect.ignoreLogged),
    );
    Effect.runFork(processJobRequestInternal(event));
  }
};
```

**OBSERVATION**: The provider DOES have telemetry for received events, but we see NO such telemetry in the logs.

### 3. Consumer Implementation Analysis

#### NIP90ServiceImpl.ts Changes
- Lines 303-307: Author filter commented out to allow ANY DVM to respond
- Lines 644-653: Consumer subscribes WITHOUT author filter
- This explains why consumer receives responses from other DVMs

#### Event Creation (event_creation.ts:58-92)
```typescript
if (targetDvmPkHexForEncryption && targetDvmPkHexForEncryption.length === 64) {
  // Encrypts content
  tags.push(["p", targetDvmPkHexForEncryption]);
  tags.push(["encrypted"]);
} else {
  // Sends unencrypted
  if (targetDvmPkHexForPTag && targetDvmPkHexForPTag.length === 64) {
    tags.push(["p", targetDvmPkHexForPTag]);
  }
}
```

**VERIFIED**: P-tag is correctly added when DVM pubkey is provided.

### 4. Configuration Analysis

From ConfigurationServiceImpl.ts (fixed):
```typescript
AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_DVM_PUBKEY: "74601f385c819159754da72f85c553142116f67c6c3684d2f0abcec55b4d3c5e"
AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_REQUIRES_ENCRYPTION: "true"
AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_USE_EPHEMERAL_REQUESTS: "true"
```

**STATUS**: Configuration is now correct with real DVM pubkey.

### 5. Mystery DVM Analysis

The DVM responding with decryption errors:
- Is NOT our monitored provider (no telemetry)
- Is listening for ALL kind 5050 events (no p-tag filter)
- Cannot decrypt our encrypted requests
- Responds immediately with error message

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Provider Isn't Receiving Events

1. **Timing Issue**: Provider's `since` filter only looks 60 seconds back
   - If provider starts AFTER consumer sends request, it misses the event
   - Events published before provider starts are invisible

2. **Relay Propagation**: 
   - Consumer published to 1 relay successfully (2 failed)
   - Provider might be connected to different relays
   - Event might not have propagated to provider's relays

3. **P-tag Filter Working**: 
   - Provider correctly filters for its pubkey in p-tags
   - Consumer correctly includes p-tag with provider's pubkey
   - But timing/relay issues prevent match

### Why Mystery DVM Responds

Some DVM on the network:
- Has NO p-tag filter (accepts all kind 5050)
- Receives our encrypted request
- Cannot decrypt (different keys or expects unencrypted)
- Responds with standard error message

## NIP-90 Protocol Understanding

**CRITICAL REALIZATION**: NIP-90 job requests are PUBLIC by design!
- P-tags are hints/preferences, NOT access control
- ANY DVM can process ANY job request
- This enables marketplace competition
- Encryption provides de facto access control

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Re-enabled Author Filters (COMPLETED)
Fixed NIP90ServiceImpl.ts in three locations:
- Lines 643 & 649: subscribeToJobUpdates now filters responses by author
- Line 304: getJobResult now filters by author  
- Line 474: listJobFeedback now filters by author

### 2. Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Remove `since` filter from provider**:
   ```typescript
   const filters: NostrFilter[] = [
     {
       kinds: supportedKinds,
       "#p": [dvmPublicKeyHex],
       // Remove: since: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 60,
     },
   ];
   ```

2. **Test with encryption disabled**:
   ```typescript
   AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_REQUIRES_ENCRYPTION: "false"
   AI_PROVIDER_DEVSTRAL_USE_EPHEMERAL_REQUESTS: "false"
   ```

3. **Ensure relay overlap**:
   - Consumer uses: nos.lol, relay.damus.io, relay.snort.social
   - Provider should use same relays

## Provider Telemetry Confirmation

The provider WILL show these telemetry events when receiving job requests:

1. **`dvm:event` / `received_job_request`** - First indicator of event reception
2. **`dvm:job` / `job_request_received`** - Confirms processing started
3. **`dvm:job` / `ai_params_intended`** - AI parameters prepared
4. **`dvm:job` / `job_result_ready`** - Result ready
5. **`dvm:job` / `job_result_published`** - Result published

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify protocol assumptions**: P-tags in NIP-90 are NOT access control
2. **Check timing filters**: `since` filters can cause silent event loss
3. **Telemetry is critical**: Missing telemetry often indicates the root cause
4. **Public protocols need filtering**: When events are public, filter responses carefully
5. **Error messages from unknown sources**: If error text isn't in codebase, it's external

## Next Steps

1. Remove `since` filter from provider subscription
2. Test with both provider and consumer using same relay set
3. Add debug logging to see ALL events provider receives
4. Test without encryption to isolate issues
5. Consider adding DVM identifier to response events for tracking
