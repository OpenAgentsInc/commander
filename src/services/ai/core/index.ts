/**
 * Core AI service abstractions for OpenAgents Commander
 *
 * This module provides the foundation for the AI integration in Commander,
 * exporting provider-agnostic interfaces and data structures that allow
 * for flexible and extensible AI services.
 *
 * The interfaces defined here are implemented by concrete provider-specific
 * classes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) to create a unified API for
 * AI interactions throughout the application.
